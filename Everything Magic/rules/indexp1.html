<h3><a name="T3"></a>Introduction</h3>

<p>This document is designed for people who've moved beyond the basics of the <b >Magic: The Gathering� </b>game. If you're a beginning <b >Magic� </b>player, you'll probably find these rules intimidating. They're intended to be the ultimate authority for the game, and you won't usually need to refer to them except in specific cases or during competitive games.</p>

<p>For casual play and most ordinary situations, you'll find what you need in the <b >Magic: The Gathering </b>basic rulebook. You can download a copy of that rulebook from the Wizards of the Coast� <b >Magic</b> rules website at <a href="http://www.wizards.com/Magic/rules" target="_top">www.wizards.com/Magic/rules</a>. If you're sure this is where you want to be, keep reading.</p>

<p>This document includes a series of numbered rules followed by a glossary. Many of the numbered rules are divided into subrules, and each separate rule and subrule of the game has its own number (note that subrules skip the letters &quot;l&quot; and &quot;o&quot; due to potential confusion with the numbers &quot;1&quot; and &quot;0&quot;; subrule 704.5k is followed by 704.5m, then 704.5n, then 704.5p, for example).</p>

<p>We at Wizards of the Coast recognize that no matter how detailed the rules, situations will arise in which the interaction of specific cards requires a precise answer. If you have questions, you can get the answers from us at <a href="http://www.wizards.com/customerservice" target="_top">www.wizards.com/customerservice</a>. Additional contact information is on the last page of these rules.</p>

<p>In response to play issues and to keep these rules as current as possible, changes may have been made to this document since its publication. See the Wizards of the Coast <b >Magic</b> rules website at <a href="http://www.wizards.com/Magic/rules" target="_top">www.wizards.com/Magic/rules</a> for the current version of the official rules.</p>
