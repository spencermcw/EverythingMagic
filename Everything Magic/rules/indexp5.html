<h1><a name="T1"></a><a name="_Ref261431310"></a><a name="bk38"></a>4. Zones</a></h1>

<p><hr size=2 align=center width="100%"></p>

<h2><a name="T2"></a>400. General</h2>

<h3><a name="T3"></a>400.1</h3>

<p>A zone is a place where objects can be during a game. There are normally six zones: library, hand, battlefield, graveyard, stack, and exile. Some older cards also use the ante zone. Some casual variants use the command zone (see section <a href="indexp10.html#bk2" target=right>9. Casual Variants</A>) Each player has his or her own library, hand, and graveyard. The other zones are shared by all players.</p>

<h3><a name="T4"></a><a name="_Ref261848021"></a><a name="bk780"></a>400.2</a></h3>

<p>Public zones are zones in which all players can see the cards' faces, except for those cards that some rule or effect specifically allow to be face down. Graveyard, battlefield, stack, exile, ante, and command are public zones. Hidden zones are zones in which not all players can be expected to see the cards' faces. Library and hand are hidden zones, even if all the cards in one such zone happen to be revealed.</p>

<h3><a name="T5"></a>400.3</h3>

<p>If an object would go to any library, graveyard, or hand other than its owner's, it goes to its owner's corresponding zone.</p>

<h3><a name="T6"></a>400.4</h3>

<p>Cards with certain card types can't enter certain zones.</p>

<h3><a name="T7"></a>400.4a</h3>

<p>If an instant or sorcery card would enter the battlefield, it remains in its previous zone.</p>

<h3><a name="T8"></a>400.4b</h3>

<p>If a plane or vanguard card would leave the command zone, it remains in the command zone.</p>

<h3><a name="T9"></a>400.5</h3>

<p>The order of objects in a library, in a graveyard, or on the stack can't be changed except when effects or rules allow it. The same is true for objects arranged in face-down piles in other zones. Other objects in other zones can be arranged however their owners wish, although who controls those objects, whether they're tapped or flipped, and what other objects are attached to them must remain clear to all players.</p>

<h3><a name="T10"></a>400.6</h3>

<p>If an object would move from one zone to another, determine what event is moving the object. If the object is moving to a public zone, its owner looks at it to see if it has any abilities that would affect the move. Then any appropriate replacement effects, whether they come from that object or from elsewhere, are applied to that event. If any effects or rules try to do two or more contradictory or mutually exclusive things to a particular object, that object's controller�or its owner if it has no controller�chooses which effect to apply, and what that effect does (note that multiple instances of the same thing may be mutually exclusive; for example, two simultaneous &quot;destroy&quot; effects). Then the event moves the object.</p>

<h3><a name="T11"></a><a name="_Ref261444030"></a><a name="bk66"></a>400.7</a></h3>

<p>An object that moves from one zone to another becomes a new object with no memory of, or relation to, its previous existence. There are six exceptions to this rule:</p>

<h3><a name="T12"></a><a name="_Ref261510129"></a><a name="bk362"></a>400.7a</a></h3>

<p>Effects from spells, activated abilities, and triggered abilities that change the characteristics of a permanent spell on the stack continue to apply to the permanent that spell becomes.</p>

<h3><a name="T13"></a>400.7b</h3>

<p>Prevention effects that apply to damage from a permanent spell on the stack continue to apply to damage from the permanent that spell becomes.</p>

<h3><a name="T14"></a>400.7c</h3>

<p>Abilities of a permanent that require information about choices made as that permanent was cast use information about the spell that became that permanent.</p>

<h3><a name="T15"></a>400.7d</h3>

<p>Abilities that trigger when an object moves from one zone to another (for example, &quot;When Rancor is put into a graveyard from the battlefield&quot;) can find the new object that it became in the zone it moved to when the ability triggered, if that zone is a public zone.</p>

<h3><a name="T16"></a>400.7e</h3>

<p>Abilities of Auras that trigger when the enchanted permanent leaves the battlefield can find the new object that Aura became in its owner's graveyard if it was put into that graveyard at the same time the enchanted permanent left the battlefield. It can also find the new object that Aura became in its owner's graveyard as a result of being put there as a state-based action for not being attached to a permanent (see rule <a href="indexp8.html#bk214" target=right>704.5n</A>)</p>

<h3><a name="T17"></a>400.7f</h3>

<p>If an effect grants a nonland card an ability that allows it to be cast, that ability will continue to apply to the new object that card became after it moved to the stack as a result of being cast this way.</p>

<h3><a name="T18"></a>400.8</h3>

<p>If an object in the exile zone is exiled, it doesn't change zones, but it becomes a new object that has just been exiled.</p>

<h3><a name="T19"></a>400.9</h3>

<p>If a face-up object in the command zone is turned face down, it becomes a new object.</p>

<h3><a name="T20"></a><a name="_Ref261852602"></a><a name="bk887"></a>400.10</a></h3>

<p>An object is outside the game if it isn't in any of the game's zones. Outside the game is not a zone.</p>

<h3><a name="T21"></a>400.10a</h3>

<p>Cards in a player's sideboard are outside the game. See rule
<a href="indexp2.html#bk43" target=right>100.4</A>.</p>

<h3><a name="T22"></a><a name="_Ref261443381"></a><a name="bk41"></a>400.10b</a></h3>

<p>Some effects bring cards into a game from outside of it. Those cards remain in the game until it ends.</p>

<h3><a name="T23"></a>400.10c</h3>

<p>Cards outside the game can't be affected by spells or abilities, except for characteristic-defining abilities printed on them (see rule <a href="indexp7.html#bk77" target=right>604.3</A>) and spells and abilities that allow those cards to be brought into the game.</p>

<h3><a name="T24"></a>400.11</h3>

<p>Some effects instruct a player to do something to a zone
(such as &quot;Shuffle your hand into your library&quot;). That action is performed on all cards in that zone. The zone itself is not affected.</p>

<h2><a name="T25"></a><a name="_Ref261849274"></a><a name="bk830"></a>401. Library</h2>

<h3><a name="T26"></a>401.1</h3>

<p>When a game begins, each player's deck becomes his or her library.</p>

<h3><a name="T27"></a>401.2</h3>

<p>Each library must be kept in a single face-down pile. Players can't look at or change the order of cards in a library.</p>

<h3><a name="T28"></a>401.3</h3>

<p>Any player may count the number of cards remaining in any player's library at any time.</p>

<h3><a name="T29"></a>401.4</h3>

<p>If an effect puts two or more cards on the top or bottom of a library at the same time, the owner of those cards may arrange them in any order. That library's owner doesn't reveal the order in which the cards go into his or her library.</p>

<h3><a name="T30"></a>401.5</h3>

<p>If a spell or ability causes a card to be drawn while another spell is being cast, the drawn card is kept face down until that spell becomes cast (see rule <a href="indexp7.html#bk217" target=right>601.2h</A>). The same is true with relation to another ability being activated.</p>

<h3><a name="T31"></a>401.6</h3>

<p>Some effects tell a player to play with the top card of his or her library revealed, or say that a player may look at the top card of his or her library. If the top card of the player's library changes while a spell is being cast, the new top card won't be revealed and can't be looked at until the spell becomes cast (see rule <a href="indexp7.html#bk217" target=right>601.2h</A>). The same is true with relation to an ability being activated.</p>

<h3><a name="T32"></a>401.7</h3>

<p>If an effect causes a player to play with the top card of his or her library revealed, and that particular card stops being revealed for any length of time before being revealed again, it becomes a new object.</p>

<h3><a name="T33"></a>401.8</h3>

<p>If an effect causes a player to put a card into a library &quot;Nth from the top,&quot; and that library has fewer than N cards in it, the player puts that card on the bottom of that library.</p>

<h2><a name="T34"></a><a name="_Ref261847877"></a><a name="bk775"></a>402. Hand</h2>

<h3><a name="T35"></a>402.1</h3>

<p>The hand is where a player holds cards that have been drawn. Cards can be put into a player's hand by other effects as well. At the beginning of the game, each player draws a hand of seven cards (see rule <a href="indexp2.html#bk219" target=right>103. Starting the Game</A>)</p>

<h3><a name="T36"></a>402.2</h3>

<p>Each player has a maximum hand size, which is normally seven cards. A player may have any number of cards in his or her hand, but as part of his or her cleanup step, the player must discard excess cards down to the maximum hand size.</p>

<h3><a name="T37"></a>402.3</h3>

<p>A player may arrange his or her hand in any convenient fashion and look at it as much as he or she wishes. A player can't look at the cards in another player's hand but may count those cards at any time.</p>

<h2><a name="T38"></a><a name="_Ref261843852"></a><a name="bk615"></a>403. Battlefield</h2>

<h3><a name="T39"></a>403.1</h3>

<p>Most of the area between the players represents the battlefield. The battlefield starts out empty. Permanents a player controls are normally kept in front of him or her on the battlefield, though there are some cases
(such as an Aura attached to another player's permanent) when a permanent one player controls is kept closer to a different player.</p>

<h3><a name="T40"></a>403.2</h3>

<p>A spell or ability affects and checks only the battlefield unless it specifically mentions a player or another zone.</p>

<h3><a name="T41"></a><a name="_Ref261845047"></a><a name="bk716"></a>403.3</a></h3>

<p>Permanents exist only on the battlefield. Every object on the battlefield is a permanent. See rule <a href="indexp2.html#bk220" target=right>110. Permanents</A>.</p>

<h3><a name="T42"></a>403.4</h3>

<p>Whenever a permanent enters the battlefield, it becomes a new object and has no relationship to any previous permanent represented by the same card, except for the cases listed in rule <a href="indexp5.html#bk66" target=right>400.7</A> (this is also true for any objects entering any zone).</p>

<h3><a name="T43"></a>403.5</h3>

<p>Previously, the battlefield was called the &quot;in-play zone.&quot; Cards that were printed with text that contains the phrases &quot;in play,&quot; &quot;from play,&quot; &quot;into play,&quot; or the like are referring to the battlefield. Cards that were printed with that text have received errata in the Oracle card reference.</p>

<h2><a name="T44"></a><a name="_Ref261847842"></a><a name="bk774"></a>404. Graveyard</h2>

<h3><a name="T45"></a>404.1</h3>

<p>A player's graveyard is his or her discard pile. Any object that's countered, discarded, destroyed, or sacrificed is put on top of its owner's graveyard, as is any instant or sorcery spell that's finished resolving. Each player's graveyard starts out empty.</p>

<h3><a name="T46"></a>404.2</h3>

<p>Each graveyard is kept in a single face-up pile. A player can examine the cards in any graveyard at any time but normally can't change their order. Additional rules applying to DCI-sanctioned tournaments may allow a player to change the order of cards in his or her graveyard.</p>

<h3><a name="T47"></a>404.3</h3>

<p>If an effect or rule puts two or more cards into the same graveyard at the same time, the owner of those cards may arrange them in any order.</p>

<h2><a name="T48"></a><a name="_Ref261443711"></a><a name="bk59"></a>405. Stack</h2>

<h3><a name="T49"></a>405.1</h3>

<p>When a spell is cast, the physical card is put on the stack
(see rule <a href="indexp7.html#bk222" target=right>601.2a</A>). When an ability is activated or triggers, it goes on top of the stack without any card associated with it (see rules <a href="indexp7.html#bk223" target=right>602.2a</A> and <a href="indexp7.html#bk224" target=right>603.3</A>).</p>

<h3><a name="T50"></a>405.2</h3>

<p>The stack keeps track of the order that spells and/or abilities were added to it. Each time an object is put on the stack, it's put on top of all objects already there.</p>

<h3><a name="T51"></a>405.3</h3>

<p>If an effect puts two or more objects on the stack at the same time, those controlled by the active player are put on lowest, followed by each other player's objects in APNAP order (see rule <a href="indexp2.html#bk225" target=right>101.4</A>). If a player controls more than one of these objects, that player chooses their relative order on the stack.</p>

<h3><a name="T52"></a>405.4</h3>

<p>Each spell has all the characteristics of the card associated with it. Each activated or triggered ability that's on the stack has the text of the ability that created it and no other characteristics. The controller of a spell is the person who cast it. The controller of an activated ability is the player who activated it. The controller of a triggered ability is the player who controlled the ability's source when it triggered, unless it's a delayed triggered ability. To determine the controller of a delayed triggered ability, see rules <a href="indexp7.html#bk52" target=right>603.7d</A>�f.</p>

<h3><a name="T53"></a>405.5</h3>

<p>When all players pass in succession, the top (last-added) spell or ability on the stack resolves. If the stack is empty when all players pass, the current step or phase ends and the next begins.</p>

<h3><a name="T54"></a>405.6</h3>

<p>Some things that happen during the game don't use the stack.</p>

<h3><a name="T55"></a>405.6a</h3>

<p>Effects don't go on the stack; they're the result of spells and abilities resolving. Effects may create delayed triggered abilities, however, and these may go on the stack when they trigger (see rule <a href="indexp7.html#bk227" target=right>603.7</A>).</p>

<h3><a name="T56"></a>405.6b</h3>

<p>Static abilities continuously generate effects and don't go on the stack (see rule <a href="indexp7.html#bk74" target=right>604. Handling Static Abilities</A>) This includes characteristic-defining abilities such as &quot;[This object] is red&quot; (see rule <a href="indexp7.html#bk77" target=right>604.3</A>).</p>

<h3><a name="T57"></a><a name="_Ref261509234"></a><a name="bk316"></a>405.6c</a></h3>

<p>Mana abilities resolve immediately. If a mana ability both produces mana and has another effect, the mana is produced and the other effect happens immediately. If a player had priority before a mana ability was activated, that player gets priority after it resolves (see rule <a href="indexp7.html#bk23" target=right>605. Mana Abilities</A>)</p>

<h3><a name="T58"></a>405.6d</h3>

<p>Special actions don't use the stack; they happen immediately. See rule <a href="indexp2.html#bk104" target=right>114. Special Actions</A>.</p>

<h3><a name="T59"></a>405.6e</h3>

<p>Turn-based actions don't use the stack; they happen automatically when certain steps or phases begin. They're dealt with before a player would receive priority (see rule <a href="indexp2.html#bk109" target=right>115.3a</A>). Turn-based actions also happen automatically when each step and phase ends; no player receives priority afterward. See rule <a href="indexp8.html#bk98" target=right>703. Turn-Based Actions</A>.</p>

<h3><a name="T60"></a>405.6f</h3>

<p>State-based actions don't use the stack; they happen automatically when certain conditions are met. See rule <a href="indexp8.html#bk10" target=right>704. State-Based Actions</A>. They are dealt with before a player would receive priority. See rule <a href="indexp2.html#bk106" target=right>115.5</A>.</p>

<h3><a name="T61"></a>405.6g</h3>

<p>A player may concede the game at any time. That player leaves the game immediately. See rule <a href="indexp2.html#bk4" target=right>104.3a</A>.</p>

<h3><a name="T62"></a>405.6h</h3>

<p>If a player leaves a multiplayer game, objects may leave the game, cease to exist, change control, or be exiled as a result. These actions happen immediately. See rule <a href="indexp9.html#bk237" target=right>800.4a</A>.</p>

<h2><a name="T63"></a><a name="_Ref261510465"></a><a name="bk383"></a>406. Exile</h2>

<h3><a name="T64"></a>406.1</h3>

<p>The exile zone is essentially a holding area for objects. Some spells and abilities exile an object without any way to return that object to another zone. Other spells and abilities exile an object only temporarily.</p>

<h3><a name="T65"></a>406.2</h3>

<p>To exile an object is to put it into the exile zone from whatever zone it's currently in. An exiled card is a card that's been put into the exile zone.</p>

<h3><a name="T66"></a>406.3</h3>

<p>Exiled cards are, by default, kept face up and may be examined by any player at any time. Cards &quot;exiled face down&quot; can't be examined by any player except when instructions allow it.</p>

<h3><a name="T67"></a>406.4</h3>

<p>Exiled cards that might return to the battlefield or any other zone should be kept in separate piles to keep track of their respective ways of returning. Exiled cards that may have an impact on the game due to their own abilities (such as cards with haunt) or the abilities of the cards that exiled them should likewise be kept in separate piles.</p>

<h3><a name="T68"></a>406.5</h3>

<p>An object may have one ability printed on it that causes one or more cards to be exiled, and another ability that refers either to &quot;the exiled cards&quot; or to cards &quot;exiled with [this object].&quot; These abilities are linked: the second refers only to cards that have been exiled due to the first. See rule <a href="indexp7.html#bk238" target=right>607. Linked Abilities</A>.</p>

<h3><a name="T69"></a>406.6</h3>

<p>If an object in the exile zone becomes exiled, it doesn't change zones, but it becomes a new object that has just been exiled.</p>

<h3><a name="T70"></a>406.7</h3>

<p>Previously, the exile zone was called the &quot;removed-from-the-game zone.&quot; Cards that were printed with text that &quot;removes [an object] from the game&quot; exiles that object. The same is true for cards printed with text that &quot;sets [an object] aside.&quot; Cards that were printed with that text have received errata in the Oracle card reference.</p>

<h2><a name="T71"></a><a name="_Ref261443245"></a><a name="bk39"></a>407. Ante</h2>

<h3><a name="T72"></a>407.1</h3>

<p>Earlier versions of the Magic rules included an ante rule as a way of playing &quot;for keeps.&quot; Playing Magic games for ante is now considered an optional variation on the game, and it's allowed only where it's not forbidden by law or by other rules. Playing for ante is strictly forbidden under the Magic: The Gathering Tournament Rules (<a href="http://www.wizards.com/Magic/TCG/Events.aspx?x=dci/doccenter/home" target="_top"><span
>http://www.wizards.com/Magic/TCG/Events.aspx?x=dci/doccenter/home</a>).</p>

<h3><a name="T73"></a>407.2</h3>

<p>When playing for ante, each player puts one random card from his or her deck into the ante zone after determining which player goes first but before players draw any cards. Cards in the ante zone may be examined by any player at any time. At the end of the game, the winner becomes the owner of all the cards in the ante zone.</p>

<h3><a name="T74"></a>407.3</h3>

<p>A few cards have the text &quot;Remove [this card] from your deck before playing if you're not playing for ante.&quot; These are the only cards that can add or remove cards from the ante zone or change a card's owner.</p>

<h3><a name="T75"></a>407.4</h3>

<p>To ante an object is to put that object into the ante zone from whichever zone it's currently in. The owner of an object is the only person who can ante that object.</p>

<h2><a name="T76"></a><a name="_Ref261443432"></a><a name="bk46"></a>408. Command</h2>

<h3><a name="T77"></a>408.1</h3>

<p>In certain casual variants, nontraditional Magic cards and/or specially designated cards start the game in the command zone. Each variant has its own rules regarding such cards. See section <a href="indexp10.html#bk2" target=right>9. Casual Variants</A>.</p>
