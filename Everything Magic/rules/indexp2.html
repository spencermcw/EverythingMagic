<h2><a name="T2"></a><a name="_Ref261430862"></a><a name="bk677"></a>100. General</h2>

<h3><a name="T3"></a>100.1</h3>

<p>These Magic rules apply to any Magic game with two or more players, including two-player games and multiplayer games.</p>

<h3><a name="T4"></a>100.1a</h3>

<p>A two-player game is a game that begins with only two players.</p>

<h3><a name="T5"></a>100.1b</h3>

<p>A multiplayer game is a game that begins with more than two players. See section <a href="indexp9.html#bk1" target=right>8. Multiplayer Rules</A>.</p>

<h3><a name="T6"></a><a name="_Ref261432181"></a><a name="bk834"></a>100.2</a></h3>

<p>To play, each player needs his or her own deck of traditional Magic cards, small items to represent any tokens and counters, and some way to clearly track life totals.</p>

<h3><a name="T7"></a><a name="_Ref261432251"></a><a name="bk3"></a>100.2a</a></h3>

<p>In constructed play (a way of playing in which each player creates his or her own deck ahead of time), each deck must contain at least sixty cards. A constructed deck may contain any number of basic land cards and no more than four of any card with a particular English name other than basic land cards.</p>

<h3><a name="T8"></a>100.2b</h3>

<p>In limited play (a way of playing in which each player gets the same quantity of unopened Magic product and creates his or her own deck using only this product), each deck must contain at least forty cards. A limited deck may contain as many duplicates of a card as are included with the product.</p>

<h3><a name="T9"></a>100.3</h3>

<p>Some casual variants require additional items, such as specially designated cards, nontraditional Magic cards, and dice. See section
<a href="indexp10.html#bk2" target=right>9. Casual Variants</A>.</p>

<h3><a name="T10"></a><a name="_Ref261432317"></a><a name="bk43"></a>100.4</a></h3>

<p>Each player may also have a sideboard, which is a group of additional cards the player may use to modify his or her deck between games of a match.</p>

<h3><a name="T11"></a>100.4a</h3>

<p>In constructed play, sideboards are optional, but must contain exactly fifteen cards if used. The four-card limit (see rule
<a href="indexp2.html#bk3" target=right>100.2a</A>) applies to the combined deck and sideboard.</p>

<h3><a name="T12"></a>100.4b</h3>

<p>In limited play involving individual players, all cards a player opens but doesn't include in his or her deck are in that player's sideboard.</p>

<h3><a name="T13"></a>100.4c</h3>

<p>In limited play involving the Two-Headed Giant multiplayer variant, all cards a team opens but doesn't include in either player's deck are in that team's sideboard.</p>

<h3><a name="T14"></a>100.4d</h3>

<p>In limited play involving other multiplayer team variants, each card a team opens but doesn't include in any player's deck is assigned to the sideboard of one of those players. Each player has his or her own sideboard; cards may not be transferred between players.</p>

<h3><a name="T15"></a>100.5</h3>

<p>There is no maximum deck size.</p>

<h3><a name="T16"></a><a name="_Ref261432362"></a><a name="bk17"></a>100.6</a></h3>

<p>Most Magic tournaments (organized play activities where players compete against other players to win prizes) have additional rules covered in the Magic: The Gathering Tournament Rules (found at <a href="http://www.wizards.com/Magic/TCG/Events.aspx?x=dci/doccenter/home" target="_top"><span
>http://www.wizards.com/Magic/TCG/Events.aspx?x=dci/doccenter/home</a>). These rules may limit the use of some cards, including barring all cards from some older sets.</p>

<h3><a name="T17"></a>100.6a</h3>

<p>Tournaments usually consist of a series of matches. A two-player match usually involves playing until one player has won two games. A multiplayer match usually consists of only one game.</p>

<h3><a name="T18"></a>100.6b</h3>

<p>Players can use the Magic Store &amp; Event Locator at <a href="http://www.wizards.com/locator" target="_top">www.wizards.com/locator</span></a> to find tournaments in their area.</p>

<h2><a name="T19"></a>101. The Magic Golden Rules</h2>

<h3><a name="T20"></a>101.1</h3>

<p>Whenever a card's text directly contradicts these rules, the card takes precedence. The card overrides only the rule that applies to that specific situation. The only exception is that a player can concede the game at any time (see rule <a href="indexp2.html#bk4" target=right>104.3a</A>).</p>

<h3><a name="T21"></a>101.2</h3>

<p>When a rule or effect allows or directs something to happen, and another effect states that it can't happen, the &quot;can't&quot; effect takes precedence.</p>

<h4><a name="T22"></a>Example: </h4>

<p>If one effect reads &quot;You may play an additional land this turn&quot; and another reads &quot;You can't play land cards this turn,&quot; the effect that precludes you from playing lands wins.</p>

<h3><a name="T23"></a>101.2a</h3>

<p>Adding abilities to objects and removing abilities from objects don't fall under this rule (see rule <a href="indexp2.html#bk5" target=right>112.10</A>)</p>

<h3><a name="T24"></a>101.3</h3>

<p>Any part of an instruction that's impossible to perform is ignored (in many cases the card will specify consequences for this; if it doesn't, there's no effect).</p>

<h3><a name="T25"></a><a name="_Ref261432420"></a><a name="bk225"></a>101.4</a></h3>

<p>If multiple players would make choices and/or take actions at the same time, the active player (the player whose turn it is) makes any choices required, then the next player in turn order (usually the player seated to the active player's left) makes any choices required, followed by the remaining nonactive players in turn order. Then the actions happen simultaneously. This rule is often referred to as the &quot;Active Player, Nonactive Player (APNAP) order&quot; rule.</p>

<h4><a name="T26"></a>Example: </h4>

<p>A card reads &quot;Each player sacrifices a creature.&quot; First, the active player chooses a creature he or she controls. Then each of the nonactive players, in turn order, chooses a creature he or she controls. Then all creatures chosen this way are sacrificed simultaneously.</p>

<h3><a name="T27"></a>101.4a</h3>

<p>If an effect has each player choose a card in a hidden zone, such as his or her hand or library, those cards may remain face down as they're chosen. However, each player must clearly indicate which face-down card he or she is choosing.</p>

<h3><a name="T28"></a>101.4b</h3>

<p>A player knows the choices made by the previous players when he or she makes his or her choice, except as specified in 101.4a.</p>

<h3><a name="T29"></a>101.4c</h3>

<p>If a player would make more than one choice at the same time, the player makes the choices in the order written, or in the order he or she chooses if the choices aren't ordered.</p>

<h3><a name="T30"></a>101.4d</h3>

<p>If a choice made by a nonactive player causes the active player, or a different nonactive player earlier in the turn order, to have to make a choice, APNAP order is restarted for all outstanding choices.</p>

<h2><a name="T31"></a><a name="_Ref261432626"></a><a name="bk926"></a>102. Players</h2>

<h3><a name="T32"></a><a name="_Ref261432581"></a><a name="bk577"></a>102.1</a></h3>

<p>A player is one of the people in the game. The active player is the player whose turn it is. The other players are nonactive players.</p>

<h3><a name="T33"></a><a name="_Ref261849901"></a><a name="bk883"></a>102.2</a></h3>

<p>In a two-player game, a player's opponent is the other player.</p>

<h3><a name="T34"></a><a name="_Ref261432544"></a><a name="bk884"></a>102.3</a></h3>

<p>In a multiplayer game between teams, a player's teammates are the other players on his or her team, and the player's opponents are all players not on his or her team.</p>

<h2><a name="T35"></a><a name="_Ref261430932"></a><a name="bk219"></a>103. Starting the Game</h2>

<h3><a name="T36"></a><a name="_Ref261432767"></a><a name="bk974"></a>103.1</a></h3>

<p>At the start of a game, each player shuffles his or her deck so that the cards are in a random order. Each player may then shuffle or cut his or her opponents' decks. The players' decks become their libraries.</p>

<h3><a name="T37"></a>103.2</h3>

<p>After the decks have been shuffled, the players determine which one of them will choose who takes the first turn. In the first game of a match (including a single-game match), the players may use any mutually agreeable method (flipping a coin, rolling dice, etc.) to do so. In a match of several games, the loser of the previous game chooses who takes the first turn. If the previous game was a draw, the player who made the choice in that game makes the choice in this game.</p>

<h3><a name="T38"></a>103.3</h3>

<p>Once the starting player has been determined, each player sets his or her life total to 20 and draws a hand of seven cards.</p>

<h3><a name="T39"></a>103.3a</h3>

<p>In a Two-Headed Giant game, each team starts with a shared life total of 30 instead.</p>

<h3><a name="T40"></a>103.3b</h3>

<p>In a Vanguard game, each player sets his or her life total to 20, as modified by the life modifier of his or her vanguard card, and draws a hand of seven cards, as modified by the hand modifier of his or her vanguard card.</p>

<h3><a name="T41"></a>103.3c</h3>

<p>In an EDH game, each player sets his or her life total to 40.</p>

<h3><a name="T42"></a><a name="_Ref261432806"></a><a name="bk868"></a>103.4</a></h3>

<p>A player who is dissatisfied with his or her initial hand may take a mulligan. First, the starting player declares whether or not he or she will take a mulligan. Then each other player in turn order does the same. Once each player has made a declaration, all players who decided to take mulligans do so at the same time. To take a mulligan, a player shuffles his or her hand back into his or her library, then draws a new hand of one fewer cards than he or she had before. If a player kept his or her hand of cards, those cards become the player's opening hand, and that player may not take any further mulligans. This process is then repeated until no player takes a mulligan (note that if a player's hand size reaches zero cards, that player must keep that hand).</p>

<h3><a name="T43"></a>103.4a</h3>

<p>If an effect allows a player to perform an action &quot;any time [that player] could mulligan,&quot; the player may perform that action at a time he or she would declare whether or not he or she will take a mulligan. This need not be in the first round of mulligans. Other players may have already made their mulligan declarations by the time the player has the option to perform this action. If the player performs the action, he or she then declares whether or not he or she will take a mulligan.</p>

<h3><a name="T44"></a>103.4b</h3>

<p>In a multiplayer game, the first time a player takes a mulligan, he or she draws a new hand of as many cards as he or she had before. Subsequent hands decrease by one card as normal.</p>

<h3><a name="T45"></a>103.4c</h3>

<p>The Two-Headed Giant variant uses the multiplayer mulligan rule, with a slight modification. First, each player on the starting team declares whether or not he or she will take a mulligan. Then the players on each other team in turn order do the same. Then all mulligans are taken at the same time. A player may take a mulligan even after his or her teammate has decided to keep his or her opening hand.</p>

<h3><a name="T46"></a>103.4d</h3>

<p>The EDH casual variant uses an alternate mulligan rule. Each time a player takes a mulligan, rather than shuffling his or her entire hand of cards into his or her library, that player exiles any number of cards from his or her hand. Then the player draws a number of cards equal to one less than the number of cards he or she exiled this way. Once a player keeps an opening hand, that player shuffles all cards he or she exiled this way into his or her library.</p>

<h3><a name="T47"></a>103.5</h3>

<p>Once all players have kept their opening hands, if any cards in the starting player's hand allow that player to begin the game with those cards on the battlefield, he or she may put any or all of them onto the battlefield. Then each other player in turn order may do the same.</p>

<h3><a name="T48"></a><a name="_Ref261432855"></a><a name="bk558"></a>103.6</a></h3>

<p>In a Planar Magic game, the starting player moves the top card of his or her planar deck off that planar deck and turns it face up (see rule <a href="indexp10.html#bk6" target=right>901. Planar Magic</A>)</p>

<h3><a name="T49"></a>103.7</h3>

<p>The starting player takes his or her first turn.</p>

<h3><a name="T50"></a>103.7a</h3>

<p>In a two-player game, the player who plays first skips the draw step (see rule <a href="indexp6.html#bk7" target=right>504. Draw Step</A>) of his or her first turn.</p>

<h3><a name="T51"></a>103.7b</h3>

<p>In a Two-Headed Giant game, the team who plays first skips the draw step of their first turn.</p>

<h3><a name="T52"></a>103.7c</h3>

<p>In all other multiplayer games, no player skips the draw step of his or her first turn.</p>

<h2><a name="T53"></a><a name="_Ref261436319"></a><a name="bk546"></a>104. Winning and Losing</h2>

<h3><a name="T54"></a>104.1</h3>

<p>A game ends immediately when a player wins or when the game is a draw.</p>

<h3><a name="T55"></a>104.2</h3>

<p>There are several ways to win the game.</p>

<h3><a name="T56"></a>104.2a</h3>

<p>A player still in the game wins the game if all of that player's opponents have left the game. This happens immediately and overrides all effects that would prevent that player from winning the game.</p>

<h3><a name="T57"></a>104.2b</h3>

<p>An effect may state that a player wins the game (in multiplayer games, this may not cause the game to end; see rule
<a href="indexp2.html#bk8" target=right>104.3h</A>)</p>

<h3><a name="T58"></a>104.2c</h3>

<p>In a multiplayer game between teams, a team with at least one player still in the game wins the game if all other teams have left the game. Each player on the winning team wins the game, even if one or more of those players had previously lost that game.</p>

<h3><a name="T59"></a>104.2d</h3>

<p>In an Emperor game, a team wins the game if its emperor wins the game (see rule <a href="indexp9.html#bk9" target=right>807.5</A>)</p>

<h3><a name="T60"></a><a name="_Ref261436594"></a><a name="bk312"></a>104.3</a></h3>

<p>There are several ways to lose the game.</p>

<h3><a name="T61"></a><a name="_Ref261436640"></a><a name="bk4"></a>104.3a</a></h3>

<p>A player can concede the game at any time. A player who concedes leaves the game immediately. He or she loses the game.</p>

<h3><a name="T62"></a>104.3b</h3>

<p>If a player's life total is 0 or less, he or she loses the game the next time a player would receive priority (This is a state-based action. See rule <a href="indexp8.html#bk10" target=right>704. State-Based Actions</A>)</p>

<h3><a name="T63"></a>104.3c</h3>

<p>If a player is required to draw more cards than are left in his or her library, he or she draws the remaining cards, and then loses the game the next time a player would receive priority (This is a state-based action. See rule <a href="indexp8.html#bk10" target=right>704. State-Based Actions</A>)</p>

<h3><a name="T64"></a><a name="_Ref261436712"></a><a name="bk460"></a>104.3d</a></h3>

<p>If a player has ten or more poison counters, he or she loses the game the next time a player would receive priority (This is a state-based action. See rule <a href="indexp8.html#bk10" target=right>704. State-Based Actions</A>)</p>

<h3><a name="T65"></a>104.3e</h3>

<p>An effect may state that a player loses the game.</p>

<h3><a name="T66"></a>104.3f</h3>

<p>If a player would both win and lose simultaneously, he or she loses.</p>

<h3><a name="T67"></a>104.3g</h3>

<p>In a multiplayer game between teams, a team loses the game if all players on that team have lost.</p>

<h3><a name="T68"></a><a name="_Ref261436753"></a><a name="bk8"></a>104.3h</a></h3>

<p>In a multiplayer game, an effect that states that a player wins the game instead causes all of that player's opponents to lose the game
(this may not cause the game to end if the limited range of influence option is being used; see rule <a href="indexp9.html#bk13" target=right>801. Limited Range of Influence Option</A>)</p>

<h3><a name="T69"></a>104.3i</h3>

<p>In an Emperor game, a team loses the game if its emperor loses the game (see rule <a href="indexp9.html#bk9" target=right>807.5</A>)</p>

<h3><a name="T70"></a>104.3j</h3>

<p>In an EDH game, a player that's been dealt 21 or more combat damage by the same general over the course of the game loses the game (This is a state-based action. See rule <a href="indexp8.html#bk10" target=right>704. State-Based Actions</A>. Also see rule <a href="indexp10.html#bk16" target=right>903.12</A>).</p>

<h3><a name="T71"></a>104.3k</h3>

<p>In a tournament, a player may lose a game as a result of a penalty given by a judge. See rule <a href="indexp2.html#bk17" target=right>100.6</A>.</p>

<h3><a name="T72"></a><a name="_Ref261436799"></a><a name="bk698"></a>104.4</a></h3>

<p>There are several ways to draw the game.</p>

<h3><a name="T73"></a>104.4a</h3>

<p>If all the players remaining in a game lose simultaneously, the game is a draw.</p>

<h3><a name="T74"></a><a name="_Ref261436842"></a><a name="bk515"></a>104.4b</a></h3>

<p>If the game somehow enters a &quot;loop&quot; of mandatory actions, repeating a sequence of events with no way to stop, the game is a draw. Loops that contain an optional action don't result in a draw.</p>

<h3><a name="T75"></a>104.4c</h3>

<p>An effect may state that the game is a draw.</p>

<h3><a name="T76"></a>104.4d</h3>

<h3><a name="T77"></a>104.4e</h3>

<p>In a multiplayer game using the limited range of influence option, the effect of a spell or ability that states that the game is a draw causes the game to be a draw for that spell or ability's controller and all players within his or her range of influence. Only those players leave the game; the game continues for all other players.</p>

<h3><a name="T78"></a>104.4f</h3>

<p>In a multiplayer game between teams, the game is a draw for a team if the game is a draw for all remaining players on that team.</p>

<h3><a name="T79"></a>104.4g</h3>

<h3><a name="T80"></a>104.5</h3>

<p>If a player loses the game, he or she leaves the game. If the game is a draw for a player, he or she leaves the game. The multiplayer rules handle what happens when a player leaves the game; see rule
<a href="indexp9.html#bk19" target=right>800.4</A>.</p>

<h2><a name="T81"></a><a name="_Ref261436890"></a><a name="bk641"></a>105. Colors</h2>

<h3><a name="T82"></a>105.1</h3>

<p>There are five colors in the Magic game: white, blue, black, red, and green.</p>

<h3><a name="T83"></a>105.2</h3>

<p>An object can be one or more of the five colors, or it can be no color at all. An object is the color or colors of the mana symbols in its mana cost, regardless of the color of its frame. See rule <a href="indexp3.html#bk20" target=right>202.2</A>.</p>

<h3><a name="T84"></a>105.2a</h3>

<p>A monocolored object is exactly one of the five colors.</p>

<h3><a name="T85"></a>105.2b</h3>

<p>A multicolored object is two or more of the five colors.</p>

<h3><a name="T86"></a>105.2c</h3>

<p>A colorless object has no color.</p>

<h3><a name="T87"></a><a name="_Ref261436976"></a><a name="bk159"></a>105.3</a></h3>

<p>Effects may change an object's color or give a color to a colorless object. If an effect gives an object a new color, the new color replaces all previous colors the object had (unless the effect said the object became that color &quot;in addition&quot; to its other colors). Effects may also make a colored object become colorless.</p>

<h3><a name="T88"></a>105.4</h3>

<p>If a player is asked to choose a color, he or she must choose one of the five colors. &quot;Multicolored&quot; is not a color. Neither is &quot;colorless.&quot;</p>

<h2><a name="T89"></a><a name="_Ref261437016"></a><a name="bk643"></a>106. Mana</h2>

<h3><a name="T90"></a>106.1</h3>

<p>Mana is the primary resource in the game. Players spend mana to pay costs, usually when casting spells and activating abilities.</p>

<h3><a name="T91"></a>106.1a</h3>

<p>There are five colors of mana: white, blue, black, red, and green.</p>

<h3><a name="T92"></a>106.1b</h3>

<p>There are six types of mana: white, blue, black, red, green, and colorless.</p>

<h3><a name="T93"></a>106.2</h3>

<p>Mana is represented by mana symbols (see rule
<a href="indexp2.html#bk21" target=right>107.4</A>). Mana symbols also represent mana costs (see rule
<a href="indexp3.html#bk22" target=right>202. Mana Cost and Color</A>).</p>

<h3><a name="T94"></a>106.3</h3>

<p>Mana is produced by the effects of mana abilities (see rule
<a href="indexp7.html#bk23" target=right>605. Mana Abilities</A>). It may also be produced by the effects of spells, as well as by the effects of abilities that aren't mana abilities.</p>

<h3><a name="T95"></a><a name="_Ref261437089"></a><a name="bk854"></a>106.4</a></h3>

<p>When an effect produces mana, that mana goes into a player's mana pool. From there, it can be used to pay costs immediately, or it can stay in the player's mana pool. Each player's mana pool empties at the end of each step and phase.</p>

<h3><a name="T96"></a>106.4a</h3>

<p>If a player passes priority (see rule <a href="indexp2.html#bk24" target=right>115. Timing and Priority</A>) while there is mana in his or her mana pool, that player announces what mana is there. If any mana remains in a player's mana pool after he or she spends mana to pay a cost, that player announces what mana is still there.</p>

<h3><a name="T97"></a>106.5</h3>

<p>If an ability would produce one or more mana of an undefined type, it produces no mana instead.</p>

<h4><a name="T98"></a>Example: </h4>

<p>Meteor Crater has the ability &quot;{T}: Choose a color of a permanent you control. Add one mana of that color to your mana pool.&quot; If you control no colored permanents, activating Meteor Crater's mana ability produces no mana.</p>

<h3><a name="T99"></a>106.6</h3>

<p>Some spells or abilities that produce mana restrict how that mana can be spent, or have an additional effect that affects the spell or ability that mana is spent on. This doesn't affect the mana's type.</p>

<h4><a name="T100"></a>Example: </h4>

<p>A player's mana pool contains {1}{U} which can be spent only to pay cumulative upkeep costs. That player activates Doubling Cube's ability, which reads &quot;{3}, {T}: Double the amount of each type of mana in your mana pool.&quot; The player's mana pool now has {2}{U}{U} in it, {1}{U} of which can be spent on anything.</p>

<h3><a name="T101"></a>106.7</h3>

<p>Some abilities produce mana based on the type of mana another permanent or permanents &quot;could produce.&quot; The type of mana a permanent could produce at any time includes any type of mana that an ability of that permanent would produce if the ability were to resolve at that time, taking into account any applicable replacement effects in any possible order. Ignore whether any costs of the ability could or could not be paid. If that permanent wouldn't produce any mana under these conditions, or no type of mana can be defined this way, there's no type of mana it could produce.</p>

<h4><a name="T102"></a>Example: </h4>

<p>Exotic Orchard has the ability &quot;{T}: Add to your mana pool one mana of any color that a land an opponent controls could produce.&quot; If your opponent controls no lands, activating Exotic Orchard's mana ability will produce no mana. The same is true if you and your opponent each control no lands other than Exotic Orchards. However, if you control a Forest and an Exotic Orchard, and your opponent controls an Exotic Orchard, then each Exotic Orchard could produce {G}.</p>

<h3><a name="T103"></a>106.8</h3>

<p>If an effect would add mana represented by a hybrid mana symbol to a player's mana pool, that player chooses one half of that symbol. If a colored half is chosen, one mana of that color is added to that player's mana pool. If a colorless half is chosen, an amount of colorless mana represented by that half's number is added to that player's mana pool.</p>

<h3><a name="T104"></a>106.9</h3>

<p>To &quot;tap a permanent for mana&quot; is to activate a mana ability of that permanent that includes the {T} symbol in its activation cost. See rule <a href="indexp7.html#bk23" target=right>605. Mana Abilities</A>.</p>

<h2><a name="T105"></a>107. Numbers and Symbols</h2>

<h3><a name="T106"></a>107.1</h3>

<p>The only numbers the Magic game uses are integers.</p>

<h3><a name="T107"></a>107.1a</h3>

<p>You can't choose a fractional number, deal fractional damage, gain fractional life, and so on. If a spell or ability could generate a fractional number, the spell or ability will tell you whether to round up or down.</p>

<h3><a name="T108"></a>107.1b</h3>

<p>Most of the time, the Magic game uses only positive numbers and zero. You can't choose a negative number, deal negative damage, gain negative life, and so on. However, it's possible for a game value, such as a creature's power, to be less than zero. If a calculation or comparison that would determine the result of an effect needs to use a negative value, it does so. If such a calculation yields a negative number, zero is used instead, unless that effect sets a player's life total to a specific value, sets a creature's power or toughness to a specific value, or otherwise modifies a creature's power or toughness.</p>

<h4><a name="T109"></a>Example: </h4>

<p>If a 3/4 creature gets -5/-0, it's a -2/4 creature. It assigns 0 damage in combat. Its total power and toughness is 2. You'd have to give it +3/+0 to raise its power to 1.</p>

<h4><a name="T110"></a>Example: </h4>

<p>Viridian Joiner is a 1/2 creature that says &quot;{T}: Add an amount of {G} to your mana pool equal to Viridian Joiner's power.&quot; An effect gives it -2/-0, then its ability is activated. The ability adds no mana to your mana pool.</p>

<h3><a name="T111"></a>107.1c</h3>

<p>If a rule or ability instructs a player to choose &quot;any number,&quot; that player may choose any positive number or zero, unless something (such as damage or counters) is being divided or distributed among &quot;any number&quot; of players and/or objects. In that case, a nonzero number of players and/or objects must be chosen if possible.</p>

<h3><a name="T112"></a>107.2</h3>

<p>If anything needs to use a number that can't be determined, either as a result or in a calculation, it uses 0 instead.</p>

<h3><a name="T113"></a><a name="_Ref261437165"></a><a name="bk29"></a>107.3</a></h3>

<p>Many objects use the letter X as a placeholder for a number that needs to be determined. Some objects have abilities that define the value of X; the rest let their controller choose the value of X.</p>

<h3><a name="T114"></a>107.3a</h3>

<p>If a spell or activated ability has a mana cost, alternative cost, additional cost, and/or activation cost with an {X}, [-X], or X in it, and the value of X isn't defined by the text of that spell or ability, the controller of that spell or ability chooses and announces the value of X as part of casting the spell or activating the ability (see rule <a href="indexp7.html#bk26" target=right>601. Casting Spells</A>) While a spell is on the stack, any X in its mana cost equals the announced value. While an activated ability is on the stack, any X in its activation cost equals the announced value.</p>

<h3><a name="T115"></a>107.3b</h3>

<p>If a player is casting a spell that has an {X} in its mana cost, the value of X isn't defined by the text of that spell, and an effect lets that player cast that spell while paying neither its mana cost nor an alternative cost that includes X, then the only legal choice for X is 0. This doesn't apply to effects that only reduce a cost, even if they reduce it to zero. See rule <a href="indexp7.html#bk26" target=right>601. Casting Spells</A>.</p>

<h3><a name="T116"></a>107.3c</h3>

<p>If a spell or activated ability has an {X}, [-X], or X in its cost and/or its text, and the value of X is defined by the text of that spell or ability, then that's the value of X while that spell or ability is on the stack. The controller of that spell or ability doesn't get to choose the value. Note that the value of X may change while that spell or ability is on the stack.</p>

<h3><a name="T117"></a>107.3d</h3>

<p>If a cost associated with a special action, such as a suspend cost or a morph cost, has an {X} or an X in it, the value of X is chosen by the player taking the special action as he or she pays that cost.</p>

<h3><a name="T118"></a><a name="_Ref261437251"></a><a name="bk30"></a>107.3e</a></h3>

<p>Sometimes X appears in the text of a spell or ability but not in a mana cost, alternative cost, additional cost, or activation cost. If the value of X isn't defined, the controller of the spell or ability chooses the value of X at the appropriate time (either as it's put on the stack or as it resolves).</p>

<h3><a name="T119"></a>107.3f</h3>

<p>If a card in any zone other than the stack has an {X} in its mana cost, the value of {X} is treated as 0, even if the value of X is defined somewhere within its text.</p>

<h3><a name="T120"></a>107.3g</h3>

<p>All instances of X on an object have the same value at any given time.</p>

<h3><a name="T121"></a>107.3h</h3>

<p>Some objects use the letter Y in addition to the letter X. Y follows the same rules as X.</p>

<h3><a name="T122"></a><a name="_Ref261437295"></a><a name="bk21"></a>107.4</a></h3>

<p>The mana symbols are {W}, {U}, {B}, {R}, {G}, and {X}; the numerals {0}, {1}, {2}, {3}, {4}, and so on; the hybrid symbols {W/U}, {W/B},
{U/B}, {U/R}, {B/R}, {B/G}, {R/G}, {R/W}, {G/W}, and {G/U}; the monocolored hybrid symbols {2/W}, {2/U}, {2/B}, {2/R}, and {2/G}; and the snow symbol {S}.</p>

<h3><a name="T123"></a>107.4a</h3>

<p>There are five primary colored mana symbols: {W} is white,
{U} blue, {B} black, {R} red, and {G} green. These symbols are used to represent colored mana, and also to represent colored mana in costs. Colored mana in costs can be paid only with the appropriate color of mana. See rule
<a href="indexp3.html#bk22" target=right>202. Mana Cost and Color</A>.</p>

<h3><a name="T124"></a>107.4b</h3>

<p>Numeral symbols (such as {1}) and variable symbols (such as
{X}) represent generic mana in costs. Generic mana in costs can be paid with any type of mana. For more information about {X}, see rule
<a href="indexp2.html#bk29" target=right>107.3</A>.</p>

<h3><a name="T125"></a><a name="_Ref261855704"></a><a name="bk647"></a>107.4c</a></h3>

<p>Numeral symbols (such as {1}) and variable symbols (such as
{X}) can also represent colorless mana if they appear in the effect of a spell or ability that reads &quot;add [mana symbol] to your mana pool&quot; or something similar (see rule <a href="indexp2.html#bk30" target=right>107.3e</A>)</p>

<h3><a name="T126"></a>107.4d</h3>

<p>The symbol {0} represents zero mana and is used as a placeholder for a cost that can be paid with no resources (see rule <a href="indexp2.html#bk31" target=right>116.5</A>)</p>

<h3><a name="T127"></a><a name="_Ref261437365"></a><a name="bk158"></a>107.4e</a></h3>

<p>Hybrid mana symbols are also colored mana symbols. Each one represents a cost that can be paid in one of two ways, as represented by the two halves of the symbol. A hybrid symbol such as {W/U} can be paid with either white or blue mana, and a monocolored hybrid symbol such as {2/B} can be paid with either one black mana or two mana of any type. A hybrid mana symbol is all of its component colors.</p>

<h4><a name="T128"></a>Example: </h4>

<p>{G/W}{G/W} can be paid by spending {G}{G}, {G}{W}, or
{W}{W}.</p>

<h3><a name="T129"></a><a name="_Ref261437409"></a><a name="bk979"></a>107.4f</a></h3>

<p>The snow mana symbol {S} represents one generic mana in a cost. This generic mana can be paid with one mana of any type produced by a snow permanent (see rule <a href="indexp3.html#bk32" target=right>204.4f</A>). Effects that reduce the amount of generic mana you pay don't affect {S} costs (there is no such thing as &quot;snow mana&quot;; &quot;snow&quot; is not a type of mana).</p>

<h3><a name="T130"></a><a name="_Ref261437467"></a><a name="bk1017"></a>107.5</a></h3>

<p>The tap symbol is {T}. The tap symbol in an activation cost means &quot;Tap this permanent.&quot; A permanent that's already tapped can't be tapped again to pay the cost. A creature's activated ability with the tap symbol in its activation cost can't be activated unless the creature has been under its controller's control continuously since his or her most recent turn began. See rule <a href="indexp4.html#bk33" target=right>302.6</A>.</p>

<h3><a name="T131"></a><a name="_Ref261437544"></a><a name="bk1066"></a>107.6</a></h3>

<p>The untap symbol is {Q}. The untap symbol in an activation cost means &quot;Untap this permanent.&quot; A permanent that's already untapped can't be untapped again to pay the cost. A creature's activated ability with the untap symbol in its activation cost can't be activated unless the creature has been under its controller's control continuously since his or her most recent turn began. See rule <a href="indexp4.html#bk33" target=right>302.6</A>.</p>

<h3><a name="T132"></a>107.7</h3>

<p>Each activated ability of a planeswalker has a loyalty symbol in its cost. Positive loyalty symbols point upward and feature a plus sign followed by a number. Negative loyalty symbols point downward and feature a minus sign followed by a number or an X. Neutral loyalty symbols don't point in either direction and feature a 0. [+N] means &quot;Put N loyalty counters on this permanent,&quot; [-N] means &quot;Remove N loyalty counters from this permanent,&quot; and [0] means &quot;Put zero loyalty counters on this permanent.&quot;</p>

<h3><a name="T133"></a><a name="_Ref261437583"></a><a name="bk826"></a>107.8</a></h3>

<p>The text box of a leveler card contains two level symbols, each of which is a keyword ability that represents a static ability. The level symbol includes either a range of numbers, indicated here as &quot;N1-N2,&quot; or a single number followed by a plus sign, indicated here as &quot;N3+.&quot; Any abilities printed within the same text box striation as a level symbol are part of its static ability. The same is true of the power/toughness box printed within that striation, indicated here as &quot;[P/T].&quot; See rule <a href="indexp8.html#bk35" target=right>701. Keyword Actions</A>.</p>

<h3><a name="T134"></a>107.8a</h3>

<p>&quot;{LEVEL N1-N2} [Abilities] [P/T]&quot; means &quot;As long as this creature has at least N1 level counters on it, but no more than N2 level counters on it, it's [P/T] and has [abilities].&quot;</p>

<h3><a name="T135"></a>107.8b</h3>

<p>&quot;{LEVEL N3+} [Abilities] [P/T]&quot; means &quot;As long as this creature has N3 or more level counters on it, it's [P/T] and has
[abilities].&quot;</p>

<h3><a name="T136"></a><a name="_Ref261437623"></a><a name="bk1029"></a>107.9</a></h3>

<p>A tombstone icon appears to the left of the name of many Odyssey� block cards with abilities that are relevant in a player's graveyard. The purpose of the icon is to make those cards stand out when they're in a graveyard. This icon has no effect on game play.</p>

<h3><a name="T137"></a><a name="_Ref261437666"></a><a name="bk1052"></a>107.10</a></h3>

<p>A type icon appears in the upper left corner of each card from the Future Sight� set printed with an alternate &quot;timeshifted&quot; frame. If the card has a single card type, this icon indicates what it is: claw marks for creature, a flame for sorcery, a lightning bolt for instant, a sunrise for enchantment, a chalice for artifact, and a pair of mountain peaks for land. If the card has multiple card types, that's indicated by a black and white cross. This icon has no effect on game play.</p>

<h3><a name="T142"></a><a name="_Ref261437925"></a><a name="bk877"></a>108.2</a></h3>

<p>When a rule or text on a card refers to a &quot;card,&quot; it means only a Magic card. This includes both traditional Magic cards, which measure approximately 2.5 inches (6.3 cm) by 3.5 inches (8.8 cm) and have a &quot;Deckmaster&quot; back, and nontraditional Magic cards, which are oversized and have different backs. Tokens aren't considered cards�even a card that represents a token isn't considered a card for rules purposes.</p>

<h3><a name="T143"></a>108.2a</h3>

<p>In the text of spells or abilities, the term &quot;card&quot; is used only to refer to a card that's not on the battlefield or on the stack, such as a creature card in a player's hand. For more information, see section <a href="indexp5.html#bk38" target=right>4. Zones</A>.</p>

<h3><a name="T144"></a><a name="_Ref261852641"></a><a name="bk42"></a>108.3</a></h3>

<p>The owner of a card in the game is the player who started the game with it in his or her deck. If a card is brought into the game from outside the game rather than starting in a player's deck, its owner is the player who brought it into the game. If a card starts the game in the command zone, its owner is the player who put it into the command zone to start the game. Legal ownership of a card in the game is irrelevant to the game rules except for the rules for ante (see rule <a href="indexp5.html#bk39" target=right>407. Ante</A>)</p>

<h3><a name="T145"></a>108.3a</h3>

<p>In a Planar Magic game using the single planar deck option, the planar controller is considered to be the owner of all the plane cards. See rule <a href="indexp10.html#bk40" target=right>901.6</A>.</p>

<h3><a name="T146"></a>108.3b</h3>

<p>Some spells and abilities allow a player to take cards he or she owns from outside the game and bring them into the game (see rule
<a href="indexp5.html#bk41" target=right>400.10b</A>) If a card outside that game is involved in a Magic game, its owner is determined as described in rule <a href="indexp2.html#bk42" target=right>108.3</A>. If a card outside that game is in the sideboard of a Magic game (see rule
<a href="indexp2.html#bk43" target=right>100.4</A>), its owner is considered to be the player who started the game with it in his or her sideboard. In all other cases, the owner of a card outside the game is its legal owner.</p>

<h3><a name="T147"></a><a name="_Ref261437980"></a><a name="bk49"></a>108.4</a></h3>

<p>A card doesn't have a controller unless that card represents a permanent or spell; in those cases, its controller is determined by the rules for permanents or spells. See rules <a href="indexp2.html#bk44" target=right>110.2</A> and
<a href="indexp2.html#bk45" target=right>111.2</A>.</p>

<h3><a name="T148"></a>108.4a</h3>

<p>If anything asks for the controller of a card that doesn't have one (because it's not a permanent or spell), use its owner instead.</p>

<h3><a name="T149"></a>108.5</h3>

<p>Nontraditional Magic cards can't start the game in any zone other than the command zone (see rule <a href="indexp5.html#bk46" target=right>408. Command</A>). If an effect would bring a nontraditional Magic card into the game from outside the game, it doesn't; that card remains outside the game.</p>

<h3><a name="T152"></a>109.1</h3>

<p>An object is an ability on the stack, a card, a copy of a card, a token, a spell, or a permanent.</p>

<h3><a name="T153"></a><a name="_Ref261855775"></a><a name="bk404"></a>109.2</a></h3>

<p>If a spell or ability uses a description of an object that includes a card type or subtype, but doesn't include the word &quot;card,&quot; &quot;spell,&quot; or &quot;source,&quot; it means a permanent of that card type or subtype on the battlefield.</p>

<h3><a name="T154"></a>109.2a</h3>

<p>If a spell or ability uses a description of an object that includes the word &quot;card&quot; and the name of a zone, it means a card matching that description in the stated zone.</p>

<h3><a name="T155"></a>109.2b</h3>

<p>If a spell or ability uses a description of an object that includes the word &quot;spell,&quot; it means a spell matching that description on the stack.</p>

<h3><a name="T156"></a>109.2c</h3>

<p>If a spell or ability uses a description of an object that includes the word &quot;source,&quot; it means a source matching that description�either a source of an ability or a source of damage�in any zone. See rule <a href="indexp7.html#bk48" target=right>609.7</A>.</p>

<h3><a name="T157"></a><a name="_Ref261438095"></a><a name="bk148"></a>109.3</a></h3>

<p>An object's characteristics are name, mana cost, color, card type, subtype, supertype, expansion symbol, rules text, abilities, power, toughness, loyalty, hand modifier, and life modifier. Objects can have some or all of these characteristics. Any other information about an object isn't a characteristic. For example, characteristics don't include whether a permanent is tapped, a spell's target, an object's owner or controller, what an Aura enchants, and so on.</p>

<h3><a name="T158"></a>109.4</h3>

<p>Only objects on the stack or on the battlefield have a controller. Objects that are neither on the stack nor on the battlefield aren't controlled by any player. See rule <a href="indexp2.html#bk49" target=right>108.4</A>. There are two exceptions to this rule:</p>

<h3><a name="T159"></a>109.4a</h3>

<p>In a Planar Magic game, a face-up plane card is controlled by the player designated as the planar controller. This is usually the active player. See rule <a href="indexp10.html#bk40" target=right>901.6</A>.</p>

<h3><a name="T160"></a>109.4b</h3>

<p>In a Vanguard game, each vanguard card is controlled by its owner. See rule <a href="indexp10.html#bk51" target=right>902.6</A>.</p>

<h3><a name="T161"></a><a name="_Ref261438140"></a><a name="bk1086"></a>109.5</a></h3>

<p>The words &quot;you&quot; and &quot;your&quot; on an object refer to the object's controller, its would-be controller (if a player is attempting to cast or activate it), or its owner (if it has no controller). For a static ability, this is the current controller of the object it's on. For an activated ability, this is the player who activated the ability. For a triggered ability, this is the controller of the object when the ability triggered, unless it's a delayed triggered ability. To determine the controller of a delayed triggered ability, see rules <a href="indexp7.html#bk52" target=right>603.7d</A>�f.</p>

<h2><a name="T162"></a><a name="_Ref261438182"></a><a name="bk220"></a>110. Permanents</h2>

<h3><a name="T163"></a>110.1</h3>

<p>A permanent is a card or token on the battlefield. A permanent remains on the battlefield indefinitely. A card or token becomes a permanent as it enters the battlefield and it stops being a permanent as it's moved to another zone by an effect or rule.</p>

<h3><a name="T164"></a><a name="_Ref261852680"></a><a name="bk44"></a>110.2</a></h3>

<p>A permanent's owner is the same as the owner of the card that represents it (unless it's a token; see rule <a href="indexp2.html#bk53" target=right>110.5a</A>). A permanent's controller is, by default, the player under whose control it entered the battlefield. Every permanent has a controller.</p>

<h3><a name="T165"></a>110.2a</h3>

<p>If an effect instructs a player to put an object onto the battlefield, that object enters the battlefield under that player's control unless the effect states otherwise.</p>

<h3><a name="T166"></a>110.3</h3>

<p>A nontoken permanent's characteristics are the same as those printed on its card, as modified by any continuous effects. See rule <a href="indexp7.html#bk54" target=right>613. Interaction of Continuous Effects</A>.</p>

<h3><a name="T167"></a>110.4</h3>

<p>There are five permanent types: artifact, creature, enchantment, land, and planeswalker. Instant and sorcery cards can't enter the battlefield and thus can't be permanents. Some tribal cards can enter the battlefield and some can't, depending on their other card types. See section
<a href="indexp4.html#bk55" target=right>3. Card Types</A>.</p>

<h3><a name="T168"></a><a name="_Ref261438250"></a><a name="bk896"></a>110.4a</a></h3>

<p>The term &quot;permanent card&quot; is used to refer to a card that could be put onto the battlefield. Specifically, it means an artifact, creature, enchantment, land, or planeswalker card.</p>

<h3><a name="T169"></a><a name="_Ref261438286"></a><a name="bk897"></a>110.4b</a></h3>

<p>The term &quot;permanent spell&quot; is used to refer to a spell that will enter the battlefield as a permanent as part of its resolution. Specifically, it means an artifact, creature, enchantment, or planeswalker spell.</p>

<h3><a name="T170"></a>110.4c</h3>

<p>If a permanent somehow loses all its permanent types, it remains on the battlefield. It's still a permanent.</p>

<h3><a name="T171"></a><a name="_Ref261438336"></a><a name="bk149"></a>110.5</a></h3>

<p>Some effects put tokens onto the battlefield. A token is a marker used to represent any permanent that isn't represented by a card.</p>

<h3><a name="T172"></a><a name="_Ref261438381"></a><a name="bk53"></a>110.5a</a></h3>

<p>A token is both owned and controlled by the player under whose control it entered the battlefield.</p>

<h3><a name="T173"></a>110.5b</h3>

<p>The spell or ability that creates a token may define the values of any number of characteristics for the token. This becomes the token's &quot;text.&quot; The characteristic values defined this way are functionally equivalent to the characteristic values that are printed on a card; for example, they define the token's copiable values. A token doesn't have any characteristics not defined by the spell or ability that created it.</p>

<h4><a name="T174"></a>Example: </h4>

<p>Sprout is an instant that says &quot;Put a 1/1 green Saproling creature token onto the battlefield.&quot; The resulting token has no mana cost, supertype, expansion symbol, rules text, or abilities.</p>

<h3><a name="T175"></a>110.5c</h3>

<p>A spell or ability that creates a creature token sets both its name and its creature type. If the spell or ability doesn't specify the name of the creature token, its name is the same as its creature type(s). A &quot;Goblin Scout creature token,&quot; for example, is named &quot;Goblin Scout&quot; and has the creature subtypes Goblin and Scout. Once a token is on the battlefield, changing its name doesn't change its creature type, and vice versa.</p>

<h3><a name="T176"></a>110.5d</h3>

<p>A token is subject to anything that affects permanents in general or that affects the token's card type or subtype. A token isn't a card
(even if represented by a card that has a Magic back or that came from a Magic booster pack).</p>

<h3><a name="T177"></a>110.5e</h3>

<p>A token that's phased out, or that's in a zone other than the battlefield, ceases to exist. This is a state-based action; See rule
<a href="indexp8.html#bk10" target=right>704. State-Based Actions</A> (note that if a token changes zones, applicable triggered abilities will trigger before the token ceases to exist).</p>

<h3><a name="T178"></a>110.5f</h3>

<p>A token that has left the battlefield can't come back onto the battlefield. If such a token would return to the battlefield, it remains in its current zone instead. It ceases to exist the next time state-based actions are checked; See rule <a href="indexp8.html#bk10" target=right>704. State-Based Actions</A>.</p>

<h3><a name="T179"></a><a name="_Ref261438424"></a><a name="bk496"></a>110.6</a></h3>

<p>A permanent's status is its physical state. There are four status categories, each of which has two possible values: tapped/untapped, flipped/unflipped, face up/face down, and phased in/phased out. Each permanent always has one of these values for each of these categories.</p>

<h3><a name="T180"></a>110.6a</h3>

<p>Status is not a characteristic, though it may affect a permanent's characteristics.</p>

<h3><a name="T181"></a>110.6b</h3>

<p>Permanents enter the battlefield untapped, unflipped, face up, and phased in unless a spell or ability says otherwise.</p>

<h3><a name="T182"></a>110.6c</h3>

<p>A permanent retains its status until a spell, ability, or turn-based action changes it, even if that status is not relevant to it.</p>

<h4><a name="T183"></a>Example: </h4>

<p>Dimir Doppelganger says &quot;{1}{U}{B}: Exile target creature card from a graveyard. Dimir Doppelganger becomes a copy of that card and gains this ability.&quot; It becomes a copy of Jushi Apprentice, a flip card. Through use of Jushi Apprentice's ability, this creature flips, making it a copy of Tomoya the Revealer with the Dimir Doppelganger ability. If this permanent then becomes a copy of Runeclaw Bear, it will retain its flipped status even though that has no relevance to Runeclaw Bear. If its copy ability is activated again, this time targeting a Nezumi Shortfang card (another flip card), this permanent's flipped status means it will have the characteristics of Stabwhisker the Odious (the flipped version of Nezumi Shortfang) with the Dimir Doppelganger ability.</p>

<h3><a name="T184"></a>110.6d</h3>

<p>Only permanents have status. Cards not on the battlefield do not. Although an exiled card may be face down, this has no correlation to the face-down status of a permanent. Similarly, cards not on the battlefield are neither tapped nor untapped, regardless of their physical state.</p>

<h2><a name="T185"></a><a name="_Ref261438487"></a><a name="bk986"></a>111. Spells</h2>

<h3><a name="T186"></a>111.1</h3>

<p>A spell is a card on the stack. As the first step of being cast (see rule <a href="indexp7.html#bk26" target=right>601. Casting Spells</A>), the card becomes a spell and is moved to the top of the stack from the zone it was in, which is usually its owner's hand (see rule <a href="indexp5.html#bk59" target=right>405. Stack</A>) A spell remains on the stack as a spell until it resolves (see rule <a href="indexp7.html#bk60" target=right>608. Resolving Spells and Abilities</A>), is countered (see rule <a href="indexp8.html#bk61" target=right>701.5</A>), or otherwise leaves the stack. For more information, see section <a href="indexp7.html#bk62" target=right>6. Spells, Abilities, and Effects</A>.</p>

<h3><a name="T187"></a>111.1a</h3>

<p>A copy of a spell is also a spell, even if it has no card associated with it. See rule <a href="indexp8.html#bk63" target=right>706.9</A>.</p>

<h3><a name="T188"></a>111.1b</h3>

<p>Some effects allow a player to cast a copy of a card; if the player does, that copy is a spell as well. See rule <a href="indexp8.html#bk64" target=right>706.11</A>.</p>

<h3><a name="T189"></a><a name="_Ref261852753"></a><a name="bk45"></a>111.2</a></h3>

<p>A spell's owner is the same as the owner of the card that represents it, unless it's a copy. In that case, the owner of the spell is the player under whose control it was put on the stack. A spell's controller is, by default, the player under whose control it was put on the stack (for noncopy spells, that's the player who cast it). Every spell has a controller.</p>

<h3><a name="T190"></a>111.3</h3>

<p>A noncopy spell's characteristics are the same as those printed on its card, as modified by any continuous effects. See rule <a href="indexp7.html#bk54" target=right>613. Interaction of Continuous Effects</A>.</p>

<h3><a name="T191"></a>111.4</h3>

<p>If an effect changes any characteristics of a permanent spell, the effect continues to apply to the permanent when the spell resolves. See rule <a href="indexp5.html#bk66" target=right>400.7</A>.</p>

<h4><a name="T192"></a>Example: </h4>

<p>If an effect changes a black creature spell to white, the creature is white when it enters the battlefield and remains white for the duration of the effect changing its color.</p>

<h2><a name="T193"></a><a name="_Ref261438538"></a><a name="bk568"></a>112. Abilities</h2>

<h3><a name="T194"></a>112.1</h3>

<p>An ability can be one of two things:</p>

<h3><a name="T195"></a>112.1a</h3>

<p>An ability is a characteristic an object has that lets it affect the game. An object's abilities are defined by its rules text or by the effect that created it. Abilities can also be granted to objects by rules or effects (effects that do so use the words &quot;has,&quot; &quot;have,&quot; &quot;gains,&quot; or &quot;gain.&quot;) Abilities generate effects (see rule
<a href="indexp7.html#bk67" target=right>609. Effects</A>)</p>

<h3><a name="T196"></a>112.1b</h3>

<p>An ability can be an activated or triggered ability on the stack. This kind of ability is an object (see section <a href="indexp7.html#bk62" target=right>6. Spells, Abilities, and Effects</A>.</p>

<h3><a name="T197"></a>112.2</h3>

<p>Abilities can affect the objects they're on. They can also affect other objects and/or players.</p>

<h3><a name="T198"></a>112.2a</h3>

<p>Abilities can be beneficial or detrimental.</p>

<h4><a name="T199"></a>Example: </h4>

<p>&quot;[This creature] can't block&quot; is an ability.</p>

<h3><a name="T200"></a>112.2b</h3>

<p>An additional cost or alternative cost to cast a card is an ability of the card.</p>

<h3><a name="T201"></a>112.2c</h3>

<p>An object may have multiple abilities. If the object is represented by a card, then aside from certain defined abilities that may be strung together on a single line (see rule <a href="indexp8.html#bk69" target=right>702. Keyword Abilities</A>), each paragraph break in a card's text marks a separate ability. If the object is not represented by a card, the effect that created it may have given it multiple abilities. An object may also be granted additional abilities by a spell or ability. If an object has multiple instances of the same ability, each instance functions independently. This may or may not produce more effects than a single instance; refer to the specific ability for more information.</p>

<h3><a name="T202"></a>112.2d</h3>

<p>Abilities can generate one-shot effects or continuous effects. Some continuous effects are replacement effects or prevention effects. See rule <a href="indexp7.html#bk67" target=right>609. Effects</A>.</p>

<h3><a name="T203"></a>112.3</h3>

<p>There are four general categories of abilities:</p>

<h3><a name="T204"></a><a name="_Ref261438704"></a><a name="bk987"></a>112.3a</a></h3>

<p>Spell abilities are abilities that are followed as instructions while an instant or sorcery spell is resolving. Any text on an instant or sorcery spell is a spell ability unless it's an activated ability, a triggered ability, or a static ability that fits the criteria described in rule
<a href="indexp2.html#bk71" target=right>112.6</A>.</p>

<h3><a name="T205"></a>112.3b</h3>

<p>Activated abilities have a cost and an effect. They are written as &quot;[Cost]: [Effect.] [Activation restriction (if any).]&quot; A player may activate such an ability whenever he or she has priority. Doing so puts it on the stack, where it remains until it's countered, it resolves, or it otherwise leaves the stack. See rule <a href="indexp7.html#bk72" target=right>602. Activating Activated Abilities</A>.</p>

<h3><a name="T206"></a>112.3c</h3>

<p>Triggered abilities have a trigger condition and an effect. They are written as &quot;[Trigger condition], [effect],&quot; and begin with the word &quot;when,&quot; &quot;whenever,&quot; or &quot;at.&quot; Whenever the trigger event occurs, the ability is put on the stack the next time a player would receive priority and stays there until it's countered, it resolves, or it otherwise leaves the stack. See rule <a href="indexp7.html#bk73" target=right>603. Handling Triggered Abilities</A>.</p>

<h3><a name="T207"></a>112.3d</h3>

<p>Static abilities are written as statements. They're simply true. Static abilities create continuous effects which are active while the permanent with the ability is on the battlefield and has the ability, or while the object with the ability is in the appropriate zone. See rule <a href="indexp7.html#bk74" target=right>604. Handling Static Abilities</A>.</p>

<h3><a name="T208"></a>112.4</h3>

<p>Some activated abilities and some triggered abilities are mana abilities. Mana abilities follow special rules: They don't use the stack, and, under certain circumstances, a player can activate mana abilities even if he or she doesn't have priority. See rule <a href="indexp7.html#bk23" target=right>605. Mana Abilities</A>.</p>

<h3><a name="T209"></a>112.5</h3>

<p>Some activated abilities are loyalty abilities. Loyalty abilities follow special rules: A player may activate a loyalty ability of a permanent he or she controls any time he or she has priority and the stack is empty during a main phase of his or her turn, but only if no player has previously activated a loyalty ability of that permanent that turn. See rule
<a href="indexp7.html#bk76" target=right>606. Loyalty Abilities</A>.</p>

<h3><a name="T210"></a><a name="_Ref261445825"></a><a name="bk71"></a>112.6</a></h3>

<p>Abilities of an instant or sorcery spell usually function only while that object is on the stack. Abilities of all other objects usually function only while that object is on the battlefield. The exceptions are as follows:</p>

<h3><a name="T211"></a>112.6a</h3>

<p>Characteristic-defining abilities function everywhere, even outside the game (see rule <a href="indexp7.html#bk77" target=right>604.3</A>)</p>

<h3><a name="T212"></a>112.6b</h3>

<p>An ability that states which zones it functions in functions only from those zones.</p>

<h3><a name="T213"></a>112.6c</h3>

<p>An object's ability that allows a player to pay an alternative cost rather than its mana cost functions in any zone in which its mana cost can be paid (which, in general, means it functions on the stack). An object's ability that otherwise modifies what that particular object costs to cast functions on the stack.</p>

<h3><a name="T214"></a>112.6d</h3>

<p>An object's ability that restricts or modifies how that particular object can be played or cast functions in any zone from which it could be played or cast.</p>

<h3><a name="T215"></a>112.6e</h3>

<p>An object's ability that restricts or modifies what zones that particular object can be played or cast from functions in all zones.</p>

<h3><a name="T216"></a>112.6f</h3>

<p>An object's ability that modifies how that particular object enters the battlefield functions as that object is entering the battlefield. See rule <a href="indexp7.html#bk78" target=right>614.12</A>.</p>

<h3><a name="T217"></a>112.6g</h3>

<p>An object's activated ability that has a cost that can't be paid while the object is on the battlefield functions from any zone in which its cost can be paid.</p>

<h3><a name="T218"></a>112.6h</h3>

<p>A trigger condition that can't trigger from the battlefield functions in all zones it can trigger from. Other trigger conditions of the same triggered ability may function in different zones.</p>

<h4><a name="T219"></a>Example: </h4>

<p>Absolver Thrull has the ability &quot;When Absolver Thrull enters the battlefield or the creature it haunts is put into a graveyard, destroy target enchantment.&quot; The first trigger condition functions from the battlefield and the second trigger condition functions from the exile zone
(see rule <a href="indexp8.html#bk79" target=right>702.52 Haunt</A>)</p>

<h3><a name="T220"></a>112.6i</h3>

<p>An ability whose cost or effect specifies that it moves the object it's on out of a particular zone functions only in that zone, unless that ability's trigger condition, or a previous part of that ability's cost or effect, specifies that the object is put into that zone.</p>

<h4><a name="T221"></a>Example: </h4>

<p>Necrosavant says &quot;{3}{B}{B}, Sacrifice a creature: Return Necrosavant from your graveyard to the battlefield. Activate this ability only during your upkeep.&quot; A player may activate this ability only if Necrosavant is in his or her graveyard.</p>

<h3><a name="T222"></a>112.6j</h3>

<p>An ability that modifies the rules for deck construction functions before the game begins. Such an ability modifies not just the Comprehensive Rules, but also the Magic: The Gathering Tournament Rules and any other documents that set the deck construction rules for a specific Constructed format. However, such an ability can't affect the format legality of a card, including whether it's banned or restricted. The current Magic: The Gathering Tournament Rules can be found at <a href="http://www.wizards.com/Magic/TCG/Events.aspx?x=dci/doccenter/home" target="_top"><span
>http://www.wizards.com/Magic/TCG/Events.aspx?x=dci/doccenter/home</a>.</p>

<h3><a name="T223"></a>112.6k</h3>

<p>Abilities of plane cards and vanguard cards function in the command zone. See rule <a href="indexp10.html#bk6" target=right>901. Planar Magic</A> and rule <a href="indexp10.html#bk81" target=right>902. Vanguard</A>.</p>

<h3><a name="T224"></a><a name="_Ref261438762"></a><a name="bk983"></a>112.7</a></h3>

<p>The source of an ability on the stack is the object that generated that ability. For an activated ability, it's the object whose ability was activated. For a triggered ability (other than a delayed triggered ability), it's the object whose ability triggered. To determine the source of a delayed triggered ability, see rules <a href="indexp7.html#bk52" target=right>603.7d</A>�f.</p>

<h3><a name="T225"></a><a name="_Ref261438803"></a><a name="bk335"></a>112.7a</a></h3>

<p>Once activated or triggered, an ability exists on the stack independently of its source. Destruction or removal of the source after that time won't affect the ability. Note that some abilities cause a source to do something (for example, &quot;Prodigal Sorcerer deals 1 damage to target creature or player&quot;) rather than the ability doing anything directly. In these cases, any activated or triggered ability that references information about the source because the effect needs to be divided checks that information when the ability is put onto the stack. Otherwise, it will check that information when it resolves. In both instances, if the source is no longer in the zone it's expected to be in at that time, its last known information is used. The source can still perform the action even though it no longer exists.</p>

<h3><a name="T226"></a>112.8</h3>

<p>The controller of an activated ability on the stack is the player who activated it. The controller of a triggered ability on the stack
(other than a delayed triggered ability) is the player who controlled the ability's source when it triggered, or, if it had no controller, the player who owned the ability's source when it triggered. To determine the controller of a delayed triggered ability, see rules <a href="indexp7.html#bk52" target=right>603.7d</A>�f.</p>

<h3><a name="T227"></a>112.9</h3>

<p>Activated and triggered abilities on the stack aren't spells, and therefore can't be countered by anything that counters only spells. Activated and triggered abilities on the stack can be countered by effects that specifically counter abilities, as well as by the rules (for example, an ability with one or more targets is countered if all its targets become illegal). Static abilities don't use the stack and thus can't be countered at all.</p>

<h3><a name="T228"></a><a name="_Ref261438655"></a><a name="bk5"></a>112.10</a></h3>

<p>Effects can add or remove abilities of objects. An effect that adds an ability will state that the object &quot;gains&quot; or &quot;has&quot; that ability. An effect that removes an ability will state that the object &quot;loses&quot; that ability. Effects that remove an ability remove all instances of it. If two or more effects add and remove the same ability, in general the most recent one prevails (see rule <a href="indexp7.html#bk54" target=right>613. Interaction of Continuous Effects</A>.</p>

<h3><a name="T229"></a>112.11</h3>

<p>An effect that sets an object's characteristic, or simply states a quality of that object, is different from an ability granted by an effect. When an object &quot;gains&quot; or &quot;has&quot; an ability, that ability can be removed by another effect. If an effect defines a characteristic of the object (&quot;[permanent] is [characteristic value]&quot;), it's not granting an ability (see rule <a href="indexp7.html#bk77" target=right>604.3</A>) Similarly, if an effect states a quality of that object (&quot;[permanent]&quot; is indestructible&quot; or &quot;[creature] is unblockable,&quot; for example), it's neither granting an ability nor setting a characteristic (see rules
<a href="indexp8.html#bk86" target=right>700.4</A> and <a href="indexp8.html#bk87" target=right>700.5</A>).</p>

<h4><a name="T230"></a>Example: </h4>

<p>Muraganda Petroglyphs reads, &quot;Creatures with no abilities get +2/+2.&quot; A Runeclaw Bear (a creature with no abilities) enchanted by an Aura that says &quot;Enchanted creature has flying&quot; would not get +2/+2. A Runeclaw Bear enchanted by an Aura that says &quot;Enchanted creature is red&quot; or &quot;Enchanted creature is indestructible&quot; would get +2/+2.</p>

<h2><a name="T231"></a><a name="_Ref261853693"></a><a name="bk1018"></a>113. Targets</h2>

<h3><a name="T232"></a>113.1</h3>

<p>Some spells and abilities require their controller to choose one or more targets for them. The targets are object(s), player(s), and/or zone(s) the spell or ability will affect. These targets are declared as part of the process of putting the spell or ability on the stack. The targets can't be changed except by another spell or ability that explicitly says it can do so.</p>

<h3><a name="T233"></a>113.1a</h3>

<p>An instant or sorcery spell is targeted if its spell ability identifies something it will affect by using the phrase &quot;target
[something],&quot; where the &quot;something&quot; is a phrase that describes an object, player, or zone. The target(s) are chosen as the spell is cast; see rule <a href="indexp7.html#bk88" target=right>601.2c</A> (if an activated or triggered ability of an instant or sorcery uses the word target, that ability is targeted, but the spell is not).</p>

<h4><a name="T234"></a>Example: </h4>

<p>A sorcery card has the ability &quot;When you cycle this card, target creature gets -1/-1 until end of turn.&quot; This triggered ability is targeted, but that doesn't make the card it's on targeted.</p>

<h3><a name="T235"></a>113.1b</h3>

<p>Aura spells are always targeted. These are the only permanent spells with targets. An Aura's target is specified by its enchant keyword ability (see rule <a href="indexp8.html#bk89" target=right>702.5 Enchant</A>). The target(s) are chosen as the spell is cast; see rule <a href="indexp7.html#bk88" target=right>601.2c</A>. An Aura permanent doesn't target anything; only the spell is targeted (an activated or triggered ability of an Aura permanent can also be targeted).</p>

<h3><a name="T236"></a>113.1c</h3>

<p>An activated ability is targeted if it identifies something it will affect by using the phrase &quot;target [something],&quot; where the &quot;something&quot; is a phrase that describes an object, player, or zone. The target(s) are chosen as the ability is activated; see rule
<a href="indexp7.html#bk91" target=right>602.2b</A>.</p>

<h3><a name="T237"></a>113.1d</h3>

<p>A triggered ability is targeted if it identifies something it will affect by using the phrase &quot;target [something],&quot; where the &quot;something&quot; is a phrase that describes an object, player, or zone. The target(s) are chosen as the ability is put on the stack; see rule
<a href="indexp7.html#bk92" target=right>603.3d</A>.</p>

<h3><a name="T238"></a>113.1e</h3>

<p>Some keyword abilities, such as equip and provoke, represent targeted activated or triggered abilities. In those cases, the phrase &quot;target [something]&quot; appears in the rule for that keyword ability rather than in the ability itself (the keyword's reminder text will often contain the word &quot;target.&quot;) see rule <a href="indexp8.html#bk69" target=right>702. Keyword Abilities</A>.</p>

<h3><a name="T239"></a>113.2</h3>

<p>Only permanents are legal targets for spells and abilities, unless a spell or ability (a) specifies that it can target an object in another zone or a player, (b) targets an object that can't exist on the battlefield, such as a spell or ability, or (c) targets a zone.</p>

<h3><a name="T240"></a>113.3</h3>

<p>The same target can't be chosen multiple times for any one instance of the word &quot;target&quot; on a spell or ability. If the spell or ability uses the word &quot;target&quot; in multiple places, the same object, player, or zone can be chosen once for each instance of the word &quot;target&quot; (as long as it fits the targeting criteria).</p>

<h3><a name="T241"></a>113.4</h3>

<p>A spell or ability on the stack is an illegal target for itself.</p>

<h3><a name="T242"></a>113.5</h3>

<p>Spells and abilities that can have zero or more targets are targeted only if one or more targets have been chosen for them.</p>

<h3><a name="T243"></a><a name="_Ref261844180"></a><a name="bk632"></a>113.6</a></h3>

<p>Some effects allow a player to change the target(s) of a spell or ability, and other effects allow a player to choose new targets for a spell or ability.</p>

<h3><a name="T244"></a><a name="_Ref261855936"></a><a name="bk94"></a>113.6a</a></h3>

<p>If an effect allows a player to &quot;change the target(s)&quot; of a spell or ability, each target can be changed only to another legal target. If a target can't be changed to another legal target, the original target is unchanged, even if the original target is itself illegal by then. If all the targets aren't changed to other legal targets, none of them are changed.</p>

<h3><a name="T245"></a>113.6b</h3>

<p>If an effect allows a player to &quot;change any targets&quot; of a spell or ability, the process described in rule
<a href="indexp2.html#bk94" target=right>113.6a</A> is followed, except that any number of those targets may be changed (rather than all of them or none of them).</p>

<h3><a name="T246"></a>113.6c</h3>

<p>If an effect allows a player to &quot;choose new targets&quot; for a spell or ability, the player may leave any number of the targets unchanged, even if those targets would be illegal. If the player chooses to change some or all of the targets, the new targets must be legal.</p>

<h3><a name="T247"></a>113.7</h3>

<p>Modal spells and abilities may have different targeting requirements for each mode. An effect that allows a player to change the target(s) of a modal spell or ability, or to choose new targets for a modal spell or ability, doesn't allow that player to change its mode (see rule
<a href="indexp8.html#bk95" target=right>700.2</A>)</p>

<h3><a name="T248"></a>113.8</h3>

<p>Some objects check what another spell or ability is targeting. Depending on the wording, these may check the current state of the targets, the state of the targets at the time they were selected, or both.</p>

<h3><a name="T249"></a><a name="_Ref261855974"></a><a name="bk96"></a>113.8a</a></h3>

<p>An object that looks for a &quot;[spell or ability] that targets [something]&quot; checks the current state of that spell or ability's targets. If an object it targets is still in the zone it's expected to be in or a player it targets is still in the game, that target's current information is used, even if it's not currently legal for that spell or ability. If an object it targets is no longer in the zone it's expected to be in or a player it targets is no longer in the game, that target is ignored; its last known information is not used.</p>

<h3><a name="T250"></a>113.8b</h3>

<p>An object that looks for a &quot;[spell or ability] with a single target&quot; checks the number of times any objects, players, or zones became the target of that spell or ability when it was put on the stack, not the number of its targets that are currently legal. If the same object, player, or zone became a target more than once, each of those instances is counted separately.</p>

<h3><a name="T251"></a>113.8c</h3>

<p>An object that looks for a &quot;[spell or ability] that targets only [something]&quot; checks the number of different objects or players that became the target of that spell or ability when it was put on the stack (as modified by effects that changed those targets), not the number of those objects or players that are currently legal targets. If that number is one (even if the spell or ability targets that object or player multiple times), the current state of that spell or ability's target is checked as described in rule <a href="indexp2.html#bk96" target=right>113.8a</A>.</p>

<h3><a name="T252"></a>113.9</h3>

<p>Spells and abilities can affect objects and players they don't target. In general, those objects and players aren't chosen until the spell or ability resolves. See rule <a href="indexp7.html#bk60" target=right>608. Resolving Spells and Abilities</A>.</p>

<h3><a name="T253"></a>113.9a</h3>

<p>Just because an object or player is being affected by a spell or ability doesn't make that object or player a target of that spell or ability. Unless that object or player is identified by the word &quot;target&quot; in the text of that spell or ability, or the rule for that keyword ability, it's not a target.</p>

<h3><a name="T254"></a>113.9b</h3>

<p>In particular, the word &quot;you&quot; in an object's text doesn't indicate a target.</p>

<h2><a name="T255"></a><a name="_Ref261451034"></a><a name="bk104"></a>114. Special Actions</h2>

<h3><a name="T256"></a>114.1</h3>

<p>Special actions are actions a player may take when he or she has priority that don't use the stack. These are not to be confused with turn-based actions and state-based actions, which the game generates automatically (see rule <a href="indexp8.html#bk98" target=right>703. Turn-Based Actions</A> and rule <a href="indexp8.html#bk10" target=right>704. State-Based Actions</A>)</p>

<h3><a name="T257"></a>114.2</h3>

<p>There are six special actions:</p>

<h3><a name="T258"></a>114.2a</h3>

<p>Playing a land is a special action. To play a land, a player puts that land onto the battlefield from the zone it was in (usually that player's hand). A player can take this action any time he or she has priority and the stack is empty during a main phase of his or her turn, but only if he or she hasn't yet played a land that turn. See rule <a href="indexp4.html#bk100" target=right>305. Lands</A>.</p>

<h3><a name="T259"></a>114.2b</h3>

<p>Turning a face-down creature face up is a special action. A player can take this action any time he or she has priority. See rule <a href="indexp8.html#bk101" target=right>707. Face-Down Spells and Permanents</A>.</p>

<h3><a name="T260"></a>114.2c</h3>

<p>Some effects allow a player to take an action at a later time, usually to end a continuous effect or to stop a delayed triggered ability from triggering. Doing so is a special action. A player can take such an action any time he or she has priority, but only if the ability or effect allows it.</p>

<h3><a name="T261"></a>114.2d</h3>

<p>Some effects from static abilities allow a player to take an action to ignore the effect from that ability for a duration. Doing so is a special action. A player can take such an action any time he or she has priority.</p>

<h3><a name="T262"></a>114.2e</h3>

<p>A player who has a card with suspend in his or her hand may exile that card. This is a special action. A player can take this action any time he or she has priority, but only if he or she could begin to cast that card by putting it onto the stack. See rule <a href="indexp8.html#bk102" target=right>702.59 Suspend</A>.</p>

<h3><a name="T263"></a><a name="_Ref261730007"></a><a name="bk559"></a>114.2f</a></h3>

<p>In a Planar Magic game, rolling the planar die is a special action. A player can take this action any time he or she has priority and the stack is empty during a main phase of his or her turn. Taking this action costs a player an amount of mana equal to the number of times he or she has previously taken this action on that turn. See rule <a href="indexp10.html#bk6" target=right>901. Planar Magic</A>.</p>

<h3><a name="T264"></a>114.3</h3>

<p>If a player takes a special action, that player receives priority afterward.</p>

<h2><a name="T265"></a><a name="_Ref261442680"></a><a name="bk24"></a>115. Timing and Priority</h2>

<h3><a name="T266"></a>115.1</h3>

<p>Unless a spell or ability is instructing a player to take an action, which player can take actions at any given time is determined by a system of priority. The player with priority may cast spells, activate abilities, and take special actions.</p>

<h3><a name="T267"></a>115.1a</h3>

<p>A player may cast an instant spell any time he or she has priority. A player may cast a noninstant spell during his or her main phase any time he or she has priority and the stack is empty.</p>

<h3><a name="T268"></a>115.1b</h3>

<p>A player may activate an activated ability any time he or she has priority.</p>

<h3><a name="T269"></a>115.1c</h3>

<p>A player may take some special actions any time he or she has priority. A player may take other special actions during his or her main phase any time he or she has priority and the stack is empty. See rule <a href="indexp2.html#bk104" target=right>114. Special Actions</A></p>

<h3><a name="T270"></a>115.1d</h3>

<p>A player may activate a mana ability whenever he or she has priority, whenever he or she is casting a spell or activating an ability that requires a mana payment, or whenever a rule or effect asks for a mana payment
(even in the middle of casting or resolving a spell or activating or resolving an ability).</p>

<h3><a name="T271"></a>115.2</h3>

<p>Other kinds of abilities and actions are automatically generated or performed by the game rules, or are performed by players without receiving priority.</p>

<h3><a name="T272"></a>115.2a</h3>

<p>Triggered abilities can trigger at any time, including while a spell is being cast, an ability is being activated, or a spell or ability is resolving (see rule <a href="indexp7.html#bk73" target=right>603. Handling Triggered Abilities</A>) However, nothing actually happens at the time an ability triggers. Each time a player would receive priority, each ability that has triggered but hasn't yet been put on the stack is put on the stack. See rule <a href="indexp2.html#bk106" target=right>115.5</A>.</p>

<h3><a name="T273"></a>115.2b</h3>

<p>Static abilities continuously affect the game. Priority doesn't apply to them (see rule <a href="indexp7.html#bk74" target=right>604. Handling Static Abilities</A> and rule <a href="indexp7.html#bk108" target=right>611. Continuous Effects</A>).</p>

<h3><a name="T274"></a>115.2c</h3>

<p>Turn-based actions happen automatically when certain steps or phases begin. They're dealt with before a player would receive priority. See rule <a href="indexp2.html#bk109" target=right>115.3a</A>. Turn-based actions also happen automatically when each step and phase ends; no player receives priority afterward. See rule <a href="indexp8.html#bk98" target=right>703. Turn-Based Actions</A>.</p>

<h3><a name="T275"></a>115.2d</h3>

<p>State-based actions happen automatically when certain conditions are met. See rule <a href="indexp8.html#bk10" target=right>704. State-Based Actions</A>. They're dealt with before a player would receive priority. See rule <a href="indexp2.html#bk106" target=right>115.5</A>.</p>

<h3><a name="T276"></a>115.2e</h3>

<p>Resolving spells and abilities may instruct players to make choices or take actions, or may allow players to activate mana abilities. Even if a player is doing so, no player has priority while a spell or ability is resolving. See rule <a href="indexp7.html#bk60" target=right>608. Resolving Spells and Abilities</A>.</p>

<h3><a name="T277"></a>115.3</h3>

<p>Which player has priority is determined by the following rules:</p>

<h3><a name="T278"></a><a name="_Ref261451207"></a><a name="bk109"></a>115.3a</a></h3>

<p>The active player receives priority at the beginning of most steps and phases, after any turn-based actions (such as drawing a card during the draw step; See rule <a href="indexp8.html#bk98" target=right>703. Turn-Based Actions</A>) have been dealt with and abilities that trigger at the beginning of that phase or step have been put on the stack. No player receives priority during the untap step. Players usually don't get priority during the cleanup step (see rule <a href="indexp6.html#bk115" target=right>514.3</A>).</p>

<h3><a name="T279"></a>115.3b</h3>

<p>The active player receives priority after a spell or ability
(other than a mana ability) resolves.</p>

<h3><a name="T280"></a>115.3c</h3>

<p>If a player has priority when he or she casts a spell, activates an ability, or takes a special action, that player receives priority afterward.</p>

<h3><a name="T281"></a>115.3d</h3>

<p>If a player has priority and chooses not to take any actions, that player passes. If any mana is in that player's mana pool, he or she announces what mana is there. Then the next player in turn order receives priority.</p>

<h3><a name="T282"></a>115.4</h3>

<p>If all players pass in succession (that is, if all players pass without taking any actions in between passing), the spell or ability on top of the stack resolves or, if the stack is empty, the phase or step ends.</p>

<h3><a name="T283"></a><a name="_Ref261451143"></a><a name="bk106"></a>115.5</a></h3>

<p>Each time a player would get priority, the game first performs all applicable state-based actions as a single event (see rule <a href="indexp8.html#bk10" target=right>704. State-Based Actions</A>), then repeats this process until no state-based actions are performed. Then triggered abilities are put on the stack (see rule <a href="indexp7.html#bk73" target=right>603. Handling Triggered Abilities</A>). These steps repeat in order until no further state-based actions are performed and no abilities trigger. Then the player who would have received priority does so.</p>

<h3><a name="T284"></a>115.6</h3>

<p>In the Two-Headed Giant multiplayer variant, teams rather than individual players have priority. See rule <a href="indexp9.html#bk118" target=right>806. Two-Headed Giant Variant</A>.</p>

<h3><a name="T285"></a><a name="_Ref261848231"></a><a name="bk792"></a>115.7</a></h3>

<p>If a player with priority casts a spell or activates an activated ability while another spell or ability is already on the stack, the new spell or ability has been cast or activated &quot;in response to&quot; the earlier spell or ability. The new spell or ability will resolve first. See rule
<a href="indexp7.html#bk60" target=right>608. Resolving Spells and Abilities</A>.</p>

<h2><a name="T286"></a><a name="_Ref261431913"></a><a name="bk575"></a>116. Costs</h2>

<h3><a name="T287"></a>116.1</h3>

<p>A cost is an action or payment necessary to take another action or to stop another action from taking place. To pay a cost, a player carries out the instructions specified by the spell, ability, or effect that contains that cost.</p>

<h3><a name="T288"></a>116.2</h3>

<p>If a cost includes a mana payment, the player paying the cost has a chance to activate mana abilities. Paying the cost to cast a spell or activate an activated ability follows the steps in rules <a href="indexp7.html#bk120" target=right>601.2e</A>�g.</p>

<h3><a name="T289"></a>116.3</h3>

<p>A player can't pay a cost unless he or she has the necessary resources to pay it fully. For example, a player with only 1 life can't pay a cost of 2 life, and a permanent that's already tapped can't be tapped to pay a cost. See rule <a href="indexp3.html#bk22" target=right>202. Mana Cost and Color</A>, and rule <a href="indexp7.html#bk72" target=right>602. Activating Activated Abilities</A>.</p>

<h3><a name="T290"></a>116.3a</h3>

<p>Paying mana is done by removing the indicated mana from a player's mana pool (players can always pay 0 mana). If excess mana remains in that player's mana pool after making that payment, the player announces what mana is still there.</p>

<h3><a name="T291"></a>116.3b</h3>

<p>Paying life is done by subtracting the indicated amount of life from a player's life total (players can always pay 0 life).</p>

<h3><a name="T292"></a>116.3c</h3>

<p>Activating mana abilities is not mandatory, even if paying a cost is.</p>

<h4><a name="T293"></a>Example: </h4>

<p>A player controls Thorn of Amethyst, which says &quot;Noncreature spells cost {1} more to cast.&quot; Another player removes the last time counter from a suspended sorcery card. That player must cast that spell if able, but doing so costs {1}. The player is forced to spend {1} if enough mana is in his or her mana pool, but the player isn't forced to activate a mana ability to produce that {1}. If he or she doesn't, the card simply remains exiled.</p>

<h3><a name="T294"></a>116.4</h3>

<p>Some costs include an {X} or an X. See rule <a href="indexp2.html#bk29" target=right>107.3</A>.</p>

<h3><a name="T295"></a><a name="_Ref261442928"></a><a name="bk31"></a>116.5</a></h3>

<p>Some costs are represented by {0}, or are reduced to {0}. The action necessary for a player to pay such a cost is the player's acknowledgment that he or she is paying it. Even though such a cost requires no resources, it's not automatically paid.</p>

<h3><a name="T296"></a>116.5a</h3>

<p>A spell whose mana cost is {0} must still be cast the same way as one with a cost greater than zero; it won't cast itself automatically. The same is true for an activated ability whose cost is {0}.</p>

<h3><a name="T297"></a><a name="_Ref261505097"></a><a name="bk156"></a>116.6</a></h3>

<p>Some mana costs contain no mana symbols. This represents an unpayable cost. An ability can also have an unpayable cost if its cost is based on the mana cost of an object with no mana cost. Attempting to cast a spell or activate an ability that has an unpayable cost is a legal action. However, attempting to pay an unpayable cost is an illegal action.</p>

<h3><a name="T298"></a>116.6a</h3>

<p>If an unpayable cost is increased by an effect or an additional cost is imposed, the cost is still unpayable. If an alternative cost is applied to an unpayable cost, including an effect that allows a player to cast a spell without paying its mana cost, the alternative cost may be paid.</p>

<h3><a name="T299"></a>116.7</h3>

<p>What a player actually needs to do to pay a cost may be changed or reduced by effects. If the mana component of a cost is reduced to nothing by cost reduction effects, it's considered to be {0}. Paying a cost changed or reduced by an effect counts as paying the original cost.</p>

<h3><a name="T300"></a>116.7a</h3>

<p>If a cost is reduced by an amount of colored mana, but its colored mana component doesn't contain mana of that color, the cost is reduced by that amount of generic mana.</p>

<h3><a name="T301"></a>116.7b</h3>

<p>If a cost is reduced by an amount of colored mana that exceeds its mana component of that color, the cost's mana component of that color is reduced to nothing and the cost's generic mana component is reduced by the difference.</p>

<h3><a name="T302"></a>116.7c</h3>

<p>If a cost is reduced by an amount of mana represented by a hybrid mana symbol, the player paying that cost chooses one half of that symbol at the time the cost reduction is applied (see rule <a href="indexp7.html#bk120" target=right>601.2e</A>). If a colored half is chosen, the cost is reduced by one mana of that color. If a colorless half is chosen, the cost is reduced by an amount of generic mana equal to that half's number.</p>

<h3><a name="T303"></a><a name="_Ref261856021"></a><a name="bk291"></a>116.8</a></h3>

<p>Some spells and abilities have additional costs. An additional cost is a cost listed in a spell's rules text, or applied to a spell or ability from another effect, that its controller must pay at the same time that player pays the spell's mana cost or the ability's activation cost. A cost is an additional cost only if it's phrased using the word &quot;additional.&quot; Note that some additional costs are listed in keywords; see rule <a href="indexp8.html#bk69" target=right>702. Keyword Abilities</A>.</p>

<h3><a name="T304"></a>116.8a</h3>

<p>Any number of additional costs may be applied to a spell as it's being cast or to an ability as it's being activated. The controller of the spell or ability announces his or her intentions to pay any or all of those costs as described in rule <a href="indexp7.html#bk126" target=right>601.2b</A>.</p>

<h3><a name="T305"></a>116.8b</h3>

<p>Some additional costs are optional.</p>

<h3><a name="T306"></a>116.8c</h3>

<p>Additional costs don't change a spell's mana cost, only what its controller has to pay to cast it. Spells and abilities that ask for that spell's mana cost still see the original value.</p>

<h3><a name="T307"></a>116.8d</h3>

<p>Some effects increase the cost to cast a spell or activate an ability without using the word &quot;additional.&quot; Those are not additional costs, and are not considered until determining the total cost of a spell or ability as described in rule <a href="indexp7.html#bk120" target=right>601.2e</A>.</p>

<h3><a name="T308"></a><a name="_Ref261856075"></a><a name="bk292"></a>116.9</a></h3>

<p>Some spells have alternative costs. An alternative cost is a cost listed in a spell's text, or applied to it from another effect, that its controller may pay rather than paying the spell's mana cost. Alternative costs are usually phrased, &quot;You may [action] rather than pay [this object's] mana cost,&quot; or &quot;You may cast [this object] without paying its mana cost.&quot; Note that some alternative costs are listed in keywords; see rule <a href="indexp8.html#bk69" target=right>702. Keyword Abilities</A>.</p>

<h3><a name="T309"></a>116.9a</h3>

<p>Only one alternative cost can be applied to any one spell as it's being cast. The controller of the spell announces his or her intentions to pay that cost as described in rule <a href="indexp7.html#bk126" target=right>601.2b</A>.</p>

<h3><a name="T310"></a>116.9b</h3>

<p>Alternative costs are always optional.</p>

<h3><a name="T311"></a>116.9c</h3>

<p>An alternative cost doesn't change a spell's mana cost, only what its controller has to pay to cast it. Spells and abilities that ask for that spell's mana cost still see the original value.</p>

<h3><a name="T312"></a>116.9d</h3>

<p>If an alternative cost is being paid to cast a spell, any additional costs, cost increases, and cost reductions that affect that spell are applied to that alternative cost (see rule <a href="indexp7.html#bk120" target=right>601.2e</A>).</p>

<h3><a name="T313"></a>116.10</h3>

<p>Each payment of a cost applies to only one spell, ability, or effect. For example, a player can't sacrifice just one creature to activate the activated abilities of two permanents that each require sacrificing a creature as a cost. Also, the resolution of a spell or ability doesn't pay another spell or ability's cost, even if part of its effect is doing the same thing the other cost asks for.</p>

<h3><a name="T314"></a>116.11</h3>

<p>The actions performed when paying a cost may be modified by effects. Even if they are, meaning the actions that are performed don't match the actions that are called for, the cost has still been paid.</p>

<h4><a name="T315"></a>Example: </h4>

<p>A player controls Psychic Vortex, an enchantment with a cumulative upkeep cost of &quot;Draw a card,&quot; and Obstinate Familiar, a creature that says &quot;If you would draw a card, you may skip that draw instead.&quot; The player may decide to pay Psychic Vortex's cumulative upkeep cost and then draw no cards instead of drawing the appropriate amount. The cumulative upkeep cost has still been paid.</p>

<h3><a name="T316"></a>116.12</h3>

<p>Some spells, activated abilities, and triggered abilities read, &quot;[Do something]. If [a player] [does or doesn't], [effect].&quot; or &quot;[A player] may [do something]. If [that player] [does or doesn't],
[effect].&quot; The action [do something] is a cost, paid when the spell or ability resolves. The &quot;If [a player] [does or doesn't]&quot; clause checks whether the player chose to pay an optional cost or started to pay a mandatory cost, regardless of what events actually occurred.</p>

<h4><a name="T317"></a>Example: </h4>

<p>You control Hesitation, an enchantment that says &quot;When a player casts a spell, sacrifice Hesitation. If you do, counter that spell.&quot; A spell is cast, causing Hesitation's ability to trigger. Then an ability is activated that exiles Hesitation. When Hesitation's ability resolves, you're unable to pay the &quot;sacrifice Hesitation&quot; cost. The spell is not countered.</p>

<h4><a name="T318"></a>Example: </h4>

<p>Your opponent has cast Gather Specimens, a spell that says &quot;If a creature would enter the battlefield under an opponent's control this turn, it enters the battlefield under your control instead.&quot; You control a face-down Dermoplasm, a creature with morph that says &quot;When Dermoplasm is turned face up, you may put a creature card with morph from your hand onto the battlefield face up. If you do, return Dermoplasm to its owner's hand.&quot; You turn Dermoplasm face up, and you choose to put a creature card with morph from your hand onto the battlefield. Due to Gather Specimens, it enters the battlefield under your opponent's control instead of yours. However, since you chose to pay the cost, Dermoplasm is still returned to its owner's hand.</p>

<h3><a name="T319"></a><a name="_Ref261854145"></a><a name="bk1063"></a>116.12a</a></h3>

<p>Some spells, activated abilities, and triggered abilities read, &quot;[Do something] unless you [do something else].&quot; This means the same thing as &quot;You may [do something else]. If you don't, [do something].&quot;</p>

<h2><a name="T320"></a><a name="_Ref261849314"></a><a name="bk831"></a>117. Life</h2>

<h3><a name="T321"></a>117.1</h3>

<p>Each player begins the game with a life total of 20.</p>

<h3><a name="T322"></a>117.1a</h3>

<p>In a Two-Headed Giant game, each team begins the game with a shared life total of 30 instead; See rule <a href="indexp9.html#bk118" target=right>806. Two-Headed Giant Variant</A>.</p>

<h3><a name="T323"></a>117.1b</h3>

<p>In a Vanguard game, each player begins the game with a starting life total of 20, as modified by his or her vanguard card's life modifier. See rule <a href="indexp10.html#bk81" target=right>902. Vanguard</A>.</p>

<h3><a name="T324"></a>117.1c</h3>

<p>In an EDH game, each player begins the game with a starting life total of 40 instead; see rule <a href="indexp10.html#bk133" target=right>903. EDH</A>.</p>

<h3><a name="T325"></a>117.2</h3>

<p>Damage dealt to a player causes that player to lose that much life.</p>

<h3><a name="T326"></a>117.3</h3>

<p>If an effect causes a player to gain life or lose life, that player's life total is adjusted accordingly.</p>

<h3><a name="T327"></a>117.4</h3>

<p>If a cost or effect allows a player to pay an amount of life greater than 0, the player may do so only if his or her life total is greater than or equal to the amount of the payment. If a player pays life, the payment is subtracted from his or her life total; in other words, the player loses that much life (players can always pay 0 life).</p>

<h3><a name="T328"></a>117.4a</h3>

<p>If a cost or effect allows a player to pay an amount of life greater than 0 in a Two-Headed Giant game, the player may do so only if his or her team's life total is greater than or equal to the total amount of life both team members are paying for that cost or effect. If a player pays life, the payment is subtracted from his or her team's life total (players can always pay 0 life).</p>

<h3><a name="T329"></a>117.5</h3>

<p>If an effect sets a player's life total to a specific number, the player gains or loses the necessary amount of life to end up with the new total.</p>

<h3><a name="T330"></a>117.6</h3>

<p>If a player has 0 or less life, that player loses the game as a state-based action. See rule <a href="indexp8.html#bk10" target=right>704. State-Based Actions</A>.</p>

<h3><a name="T331"></a>117.7</h3>

<p>If an effect says that a player can't gain life, that player can't exchange life totals with a player who has a higher life total; in that case, the exchange won't happen. In addition, a cost that involves having that player gain life can't be paid, and a replacement effect that would replace a life gain event affecting that player won't do anything.</p>

<h2><a name="T332"></a><a name="_Ref261844656"></a><a name="bk672"></a>118. Damage</h2>

<h3><a name="T333"></a>118.1</h3>

<p>Objects can deal damage to creatures, planeswalkers, and players. This is generally detrimental to the object or player that receives that damage. An object that deals damage is the source of that damage.</p>

<h3><a name="T334"></a>118.1a</h3>

<p>Damage can't be dealt to an object that's neither a creature nor a planeswalker.</p>

<h3><a name="T335"></a>118.2</h3>

<p>Any object can deal damage.</p>

<h3><a name="T336"></a>118.2a</h3>

<p>Damage may be dealt as a result of combat. Each attacking and blocking creature deals combat damage equal to its power during the combat damage step.</p>

<h3><a name="T337"></a>118.2b</h3>

<p>Damage may be dealt as an effect of a spell or ability. The spell or ability will specify which object deals that damage.</p>

<h3><a name="T338"></a><a name="_Ref261510922"></a><a name="bk403"></a>118.3</a></h3>

<p>Damage may have one or more of the following results, depending on whether the recipient of the damage is a player or permanent, the characteristics of the damage's source, and the characteristics of the damage's recipient (if it's a permanent).</p>

<h3><a name="T339"></a>118.3a</h3>

<p>Damage dealt to a player causes that player to lose that much life.</p>

<h3><a name="T340"></a>118.3b</h3>

<p>Damage dealt to a planeswalker causes that many loyalty counters to be removed from that planeswalker.</p>

<h3><a name="T341"></a>118.3c</h3>

<p>Damage dealt to a creature by a source with wither causes that many -1/-1 counters to be put on that creature.</p>

<h3><a name="T342"></a>118.3d</h3>

<p>Damage dealt to a creature by a source without wither causes that much damage to be marked on that creature.</p>

<h3><a name="T343"></a>118.3e</h3>

<p>Damage dealt to an object or player by a source with lifelink causes that source's controller to gain that much life, in addition to the damage's other results.</p>

<h3><a name="T344"></a>118.4</h3>

<p>Damage is processed in a three-part sequence.</p>

<h3><a name="T345"></a>118.4a</h3>

<p>First, damage is dealt, as modified by replacement and prevention effects that interact with damage (see rule <a href="indexp7.html#bk135" target=right>614. Replacement Effects</A> and rule <a href="indexp7.html#bk136" target=right>615. Prevention Effects</A>) Abilities that trigger when damage is dealt trigger now and wait to be put on the stack.</p>

<h3><a name="T346"></a>118.4b</h3>

<p>Next, damage that's been dealt is transformed into its results, as modified by replacement effects that interact with those results
(such as life loss or counters).</p>

<h3><a name="T347"></a>118.4c</h3>

<p>Finally, the damage event occurs.</p>

<h4><a name="T348"></a>Example: </h4>

<p>A player who controls Boon Reflection, an enchantment that says &quot;If you would gain life, you gain twice that much life instead,&quot; attacks with a 3/3 creature with wither and lifelink. It's blocked by a 2/2 creature, and the defending player casts a spell that prevents the next 2 damage that would be dealt to the blocking creature. The damage event starts out as [3 damage is dealt to the 2/2 creature, 2 damage is dealt to the 3/3 creature]. The prevention effect is applied, so the damage event becomes [1 damage is dealt to the 2/2 creature, 2 damage is dealt to the 3/3 creature]. That's transformed into its results, so the damage event is now [one -1/-1 counter is put on the 2/2 creature, the active player gains 1 life, 2 damage is marked on the 3/3 creature]. Boon Reflection's effect is applied, so the damage event becomes [one -1/-1 counter is put on the 2/2 creature, the active player gains 2 life, 2 damage is marked on the 3/3 creature]. Then the damage event occurs.</p>

<h4><a name="T349"></a>Example: </h4>

<p>The defending player controls a creature and Worship, an enchantment that says &quot;If you control a creature, damage that would reduce your life total to less than 1 reduces it to 1 instead.&quot; That player is at 2 life, and is being attacked by two unblocked 5/5 creatures. The player casts Awe Strike, which says &quot;The next time target creature would deal damage this turn, prevent that damage. You gain life equal to the damage prevented this way,&quot; targeting one of the attackers. The damage event starts out as
[10 damage is dealt to the defending player]. Awe Strike's effect is applied, so the damage event becomes [5 damage is dealt to the defending player, the defending player gains 5 life]. That's transformed into its results, so the damage event is now [the defending player loses 5 life, the defending player gains 5 life]. Worship's effect sees that the damage event would not reduce the player's life total to less than 1, so it's not applied. Then the damage event occurs.</p>

<p>Damage dealt to a creature or planeswalker doesn't destroy it. Likewise, the source of that damage doesn't destroy it. Rather, state-based actions may destroy a creature or planeswalker, or otherwise put it into its owner's graveyard, due to the results of the damage dealt to that permanent. See rule <a href="indexp8.html#bk10" target=right>704. State-Based Actions</A>.</p>

<h4><a name="T351"></a>Example: </h4>

<p>A player casts Lightning Bolt, an instant that says &quot;Lightning Bolt deals 3 damage to target creature or player,&quot; targeting a 2/2 creature. After Lightning Bolt deals 3 damage to that creature, the creature is destroyed as a state-based action. Neither Lightning Bolt nor the damage dealt by Lightning Bolt destroyed that creature.</p>

<h3><a name="T352"></a><a name="_Ref261849198"></a><a name="bk823"></a>118.6</a></h3>

<p>Damage marked on a creature remains until the cleanup step, even if that permanent stops being a creature. If the total damage marked on a creature is greater than or equal to its toughness, that creature has been dealt lethal damage and is destroyed as a state-based action (see rule <a href="indexp8.html#bk10" target=right>704. State-Based Actions</A>). All damage marked on a permanent is removed when it regenerates (see rule <a href="indexp8.html#bk139" target=right>701.11</A>) and during the cleanup step
(see rule <a href="indexp6.html#bk140" target=right>514.2</A>).</p>

<h3><a name="T353"></a>118.7</h3>

<p>The source of damage is the object that dealt it. If an effect requires a player to choose a source of damage, he or she may choose a permanent; a spell on the stack (including a permanent spell); any object referred to by an object on the stack, by a prevention or replacement effect that's waiting to apply, or by a delayed triggered ability that's waiting to trigger (even if that object is no longer in the zone it used to be in); or, in certain casual variant games, a face-up card in the command zone. A source doesn't need to be capable of dealing damage to be a legal choice. See rule <a href="indexp7.html#bk48" target=right>609.7</A>.</p>

<h3><a name="T354"></a>118.8</h3>

<p>If a source would deal 0 damage, it does not deal damage at all. That means abilities that trigger on damage being dealt won't trigger. It also means that replacement effects that would increase the damage dealt by that source, or would have that source deal that damage to a different object or player, have no event to replace, so they have no effect.</p>

<h2><a name="T355"></a><a name="_Ref261844849"></a><a name="bk697"></a>119. Drawing a Card</h2>

<h3><a name="T356"></a>119.1</h3>

<p>A player draws a card by putting the top card of his or her library into his or her hand. This is done as a turn-based action during each player's draw step. It may also be done as part of a cost or effect of a spell or ability.</p>

<h3><a name="T357"></a>119.2</h3>

<p>Cards may only be drawn one at a time. If a player is instructed to draw multiple cards, that player performs that many individual card draws.</p>

<h3><a name="T358"></a>119.2a</h3>

<p>If an effect instructs more than one player to draw cards, the active player performs all of his or her draws first, then each other player in turn order does the same.</p>

<h3><a name="T359"></a>119.2b</h3>

<p>If an effect instructs more than one player to draw cards in a Two-Headed Giant game, first the primary player (seated on the right) on the active team performs all of his or her draws, then the secondary player on that team performs all of his or her draws, then the nonactive team does the same.</p>

<h3><a name="T360"></a><a name="_Ref261509595"></a><a name="bk331"></a>119.3</a></h3>

<p>If there are no cards in a player's library and an effect offers that player the choice to draw a card, that player can choose to do so. However, if an effect says that a player can't draw cards and another effect offers that player the choice to draw a card, that player can't choose to do so.</p>

<h3><a name="T361"></a>119.4</h3>

<p>A player who attempts to draw a card from an empty library loses the game the next time a player would receive priority (This is a state-based action. See rule <a href="indexp8.html#bk10" target=right>704. State-Based Actions</A>)</p>

<h3><a name="T362"></a>119.5</h3>

<p>If an effect moves cards from a player's library to that player's hand without using the word &quot;draw,&quot; the player has not drawn those cards. This makes a difference for abilities that trigger on drawing cards and effects that replace card draws, as well as if the player's library is empty.</p>

<h3><a name="T363"></a>119.6</h3>

<p>Some effects replace card draws.</p>

<h3><a name="T364"></a>119.6a</h3>

<p>An effect that replaces a card draw is applied even if no cards could be drawn because there are no cards in the affected player's library.</p>

<h3><a name="T365"></a>119.6b</h3>

<p>If an effect replaces a draw within a sequence of card draws, the replacement effect is completed before resuming the sequence.</p>

<h3><a name="T366"></a>119.6c</h3>

<p>Some effects perform additional actions on a card after it's drawn. If the draw is replaced, the additional action is not performed on any cards that are drawn as a result of that replacement effect or any subsequent replacement effects.</p>

<h3><a name="T367"></a>119.7</h3>

<p>Some replacement effects result in multiple card draws. In such a case, any parts of the original event that haven't been replaced by the effect occur first, then the card draws happen one at a time.</p>

<h2><a name="T368"></a><a name="_Ref261510030"></a><a name="bk350"></a>120. Counters</h2>

<h3><a name="T369"></a>120.1</h3>

<p>A counter is a marker placed on an object or player that modifies its characteristics and/or interacts with a rule, ability, or effect. Counters are not objects and have no characteristics. Notably, a counter is not a token, and a token is not a counter. Counters with the same name or description are interchangeable.</p>

<h3><a name="T370"></a>120.1a</h3>

<p>A +X/+Y counter on a permanent, where X and Y are numbers, adds X to that permanent's power and Y to that permanent's toughness. Similarly, -X/-Y counters subtract from power and toughness. See rule <a href="indexp7.html#bk143" target=right>613.3</A>.</p>

<h3><a name="T371"></a>120.1b</h3>

<p>The number of loyalty counters on a planeswalker on the battlefield indicates how much loyalty it has. A planeswalker with 0 loyalty is put into its owner's graveyard as a state-based action. See rule <a href="indexp8.html#bk10" target=right>704. State-Based Actions</A>.</p>

<h3><a name="T372"></a>120.1c</h3>

<p>If a player has ten or more poison counters, he or she loses the game as a state-based action. See rule <a href="indexp8.html#bk10" target=right>704. State-Based Actions</A>.</p>

<h3><a name="T373"></a>120.2</h3>

<p>If a permanent has both a +1/+1 counter and a -1/-1 counter on it, N +1/+1 and N -1/-1 counters are removed from it as a state-based action, where N is the smaller of the number of +1/+1 and -1/-1 counters on it. See rule <a href="indexp8.html#bk10" target=right>704. State-Based Actions</A>.</p>

<h3><a name="T374"></a>120.3</h3>

<p>If a permanent with an ability that says it can't have more than N counters of a certain kind on it has more than N counters of that kind on it, all but N of those counters are removed from it as a state-based action. See rule <a href="indexp8.html#bk10" target=right>704. State-Based Actions</A>.</p>

<h3><a name="T375"></a><a name="_Ref261849771"></a><a name="bk867"></a>120.4</a></h3>

<p>If an effect says to &quot;move&quot; a counter, it means to take that counter from the object it's currently on and put it onto a second object. If the first and second objects are the same object, nothing happens. If the first object has no counters, nothing happens; the second object doesn't get a counter put on it. If the second object (or any possible second objects) is no longer in the correct zone when the effect would move the counter, nothing happens; a counter isn't removed from the first object.</p>

<h3><a name="T376"></a>120.5</h3>

<p>If a spell or ability refers to a counter being &quot;placed&quot; on a permanent, it means putting a counter on that permanent while it's on the battlefield, or that permanent entering the battlefield with a counter on it.</p>
